<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Year of the Jouncer</h2><p>A great many writers use their own lives as the raw material for their work but few have done it with the wit and courage of Simon Gray. Indeed, he could be said to have developed a new literary genre, part autobiography, part razor-sharp reflections on the world around him, part penetrating observations of friends and colleagues. Like his previous best-seller, The Smoking Diaries, this new book has the rare ability to make you laugh out loud on one page and ponder the sad mysteries of mortality on the next, and sometimes to do both at the same time. Here, contained within these joyful, perceptive, compassionate pages, is the chronicle of an extraordinary Year of the Jouncer.</p><p>Simon Gray was awarded a CBE in the 2005 New Years Honours list. He is the author of over 30 plays, including Butley (1971), The Common Pursuit (1984) and Cell Mates (1995). He has published several volumes of diaries and books about the theatre, including The Smoking Diaries, Enter a Fox and Fat Chance all published by Granta. He lives in London.&#34;&#39;The funniest book I read this year was Simon Gray&#39;s The Smoking Diaries&#39; Julian Barnes, Guardian Books of the Year&#34;</p><h2>The African Queen</h2><p>During World War II, a proper English missionary and a garrulous Cockney boatman, sole survivors of a German raid, decide to strike a blow for England</p><p>6 1-hour cassettesClare West has over twenty years TEFL classroom experience in the UK and overseas, and has led workshops for teachers in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Greece, and Argentina.

The first thing is that she&#x2019;s my best friend. The second is that she always knows what to say to make me feel better. And the third thing...might take a bit more explaining.</i><br> <br>Eighty-four-year-old Florence has fallen in her flat at Cherry Tree Home for the Elderly. As she waits to be rescued, she thinks about her friend Elsie and wonders if a terrible secret from their past is about to come to light. If the charming new resident is who he claims to be, why does he look exactly like a man who died sixty years ago?<br> <br>From the acclaimed, bestselling author of <i>The Trouble with Goats and Sheep</i>, <i>Three Things About Elsie </i>&#x201c;breathes with suspense, providing along the way piercing, poetic descriptions, countless tiny mysteries, and breathtaking little reveals...a rich portrait of old age and friendship stretched over a fascinating frame&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus </i>Reviews, starred review). This is an &#x201c;amusing and heartbreaking&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) story about forever friends on the twisting path of life who come to understand how the fine threads of humanity connect us all.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2018:</strong> 84-year-old Florence has fallen and she can&#x2019;t get up. While waiting for rescue from the floor of her assisted living facility, she begins recounting the mystery of its newest resident, a man who looks and acts suspiciously like someone she was glad to see die sixty years ago. Aided by two unbelievably charming and loyal friends, Florence is determined to find out why he&#x2019;s resurfaced. With dementia setting in, her mind isn&#x2019;t as sharp as it once was, and the clues are hard to keep straight -- but she refuses to stop until the secrets are uncovered. Pick this up if you love a mystery told by an unreliable narrator, but stay for the friendship story. The bond between this senior citizen trio is heartwarmingly enviable. <em>--Sydney Dale</em>Joanna Cannon is a psychiatrist with a degree from Leicester Medical School.

He entered college just as World War II began and dreamed of being a naval aviator. It seemed as if every night his fraternity was having a party to send off a brother to the service. Young Arness got his interview with a naval flight program officer, but his hopes vanished as he was informed that his six foot seven inch height disqualified him automatically. He wrote his draft board asking that they call him up as soon as possible and so he ended up as a private in the famed Third Infantry Division where he earned a Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Because of his stature, he was chosen to be first off the landing craft (to test the depth of the water) when his division landed at Anzio, Italy. He was subsequently wounded by enemy machine gun fire and spent eighteen months recovering in overseas and stateside hospitals. Later his height would help him strike a commanding figure in the role of U.S. Marshal Matt Dillon of Dodge City. After Arness had toiled in Hollywood for a decade, John Wayne recommended him to CBS executives for the Gunsmoke part (after Wayne turned it down). As the principal performer of Gunsmoke for twenty years (1955-1975), the actor and the character took on mythic proportions--a born leader, honest and strong. Rare is the actor who has been cast in a role that so deeply fits his true self. James Arness gives a full account of his early years, his family, his military career, his film work in Hollywood which included appearances in the cult-favorite science fiction movies Them! and The Thing. He had a long run on Gunsmoke, a role in the highly popular television miniseries How The West Was Won, and his post-theatrical period is also covered. This is the long anticipated, never-before-told account of one of the icons of twentieth-century television. There are many personal revelations of interacting with some of the Gunsmoke family ensemble, such as Miss Kitty, Doc and Festus. His own work as a producer is covered. Throughout are rare, previously unpublished photographs from the author&#39;s personal collection. Appendices include comments by show biz colleagues and fellow Gunsmoke alumni, and a sampling of letters received from his legions of fans. As befits the man, this large-size book is a beautifully printed work in accord with the highest library standards--a luxurious and extra-strong cloth binding, acid-free paper, carefully designed photographic and textual layouts and sophisticated typography. Actor and fellow Gunsmoke performer Burt Reynolds has written a foreword to the book.</p><p>James Arness gives the full story on his early years, his family, his military career and his film work in Hollywood, including appearances in the cult-favorite science fiction movies Them! and The Thing.

Sarton, who will be 79 on publication daynifty! , writes of solitude, of ardent love and friendship, houses and gardens, painting and music, and the erotic act of art--as in her poems "The Consummation" and "The Lady and the Unicorn." Her animal poems are poignant, often making application to humans; in "Of Molluscs" lovers, too, are "shelled up in fears." Sarton explores age, sickness (in the novel A Reckoning ), even death as thresholds of deepening experience: the subjects of the poem "Old Lovers at the Ballet" find in themselves that "the soul is a lithe and serene athlete." The narrator of "My Father's Death" compares her bereavement to a ship's being "gently set free, / The landlocked, launched," and announces that she has "slipped out from the embracing shore"' into new life. Poems of grief include a brilliant sestina, "The Concentration Camps," with its unrelenting evocation of dead children's shoes. Westbrook College professor Daziel's gauche introduction dwells on Sarton's detractors, presuming the critical "fate of May Sarton" will be as a celebrant of "traditionally female values (e.g. nurture) as opposed to someone like Joseph Conrad"--a wildly inept equation, for Sarton offers universally humane reflections in a feast of words. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."There is much I still hope to do," concludes then 75-year-old Sarton in After the Stroke: A Journal. The remarkably long career of poet/novelist Sarton, born in Belgium in 1912, is well represented in this anthology. With introductory essays by Daziel and Constance Hunting, this book offers selections from 13 of her books of poetry (written from 1930 to 1988), eight autobiographical writings, and a brief excerpt from the novel A Reckoning ( LJ 9/1/78). The novella As We Are Now (8/73) about a former teacher's painful confinement in a nursing home, is printed in its entirety. Concerned with healing and solitude, Sarton's prolific work is rooted in a New England tradition of self-analysis and community values. The unadorned prose of her journals, written even after a mastectomy and recovery from a stroke, presents this compassionate survivor, 79 years old at the publication of this work, at her best.<br><i>-Frank Allen, Schenectady Cty.

Erikson&#39;s major essays on topics originating in the concept of the adolescent identity crisis. Identity, Erikson writes, is as unfathomable as it is all-pervasive. It deals with a process that is located both in the core of the individual and in the core of the communal culture. As the culture changes, new kinds of identity questions arise--Erikson comments, for example, on issues of social protest and changing gender roles that were particular to the 1960s.A winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, Erik H. Erikson was renowned worldwide as teacher, clinician, and theorist in the field of psychoanalysis and human development.</p><h2>A Left-Handed History of the World</h2><p>Julius Caesar and Isaac Newton were left-handed. So are Paul McCartney and Bill Gates. Intriguingly, a disproportionate number of U.S. presidents have also been lefties. Why is it that such a high number of left-handed people factor in influential moments through history? Through fascinating case studies of notables from ancient to modern times, Ed Wright explains the secret of lefty success. Psychology meets history in this enlightening and entertaining look being left-handed and its effects on our world. The list of successful and influential people of the &#39;sinister nation&#39; - from Alexander the Great to Joan of Arc, Henry Ford to Jimi Hendrix -will wow both left- and right-handers. Exploring the defining character traits of these and other famous lefties, we discover how much the world has gained from those who look at life from the other side.</p><p></p><h2>Bible Truths Student Grd 8 Level B 3rd Edition</h2><p>RustyRiver offers fast daily shipping and 100% customer satisfaction GUARANTEED!

Ty Calder has recovered from the kidnap/shooting that ended Calder Pride, and he and Jessy are joyfully expecting twins. Jessy, a cowhand's daughter, grew up on the ranch and shares a love for the land with Ty and Ty's father, Chase. The one obstacle to the family's continued prosperity is a 10,000-acre parcel of government land that lies within the ranch boundaries; negotiations for clear title are stalled in political wrangling between cattlemen and environmentalists. Jessy's nemesis is Tara, the glamorous daughter of rich industrialist E.J. Dyson, who was Ty's first wife. When Dyson suffers a fatal heart attack, a distraught Tara begs Cat, Ty's sister, who was once close to her, and Ty himself, to attend the Texas funeral.

Meanwhile, Jessy's twins are born, ex-convict Buck Haskell (once Chase's best friend) reappears and tensions build between Ty and Jessy he resents cowhand Ballard's attentions to Jessy; she distrusts Tara.

This brilliant, allegorical tale of seduction and personal and societal ruin, set amidst exquisite, wistful descriptions of a waning aristocratic age, provides an essential link to our understanding of Roth's extraordinary fictive powers. <br></p><p>Before his death in 1939, Joseph Roth produced 13 works of fiction--most of them sardonic valentines to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As a Galician Jew, not to mention a biting social critic, Roth knew that life under the Dual Monarchy was not exactly flawless. Yet he retained a deep attachment to the old regime, which must have looked more and more civilized as the Nazis came to power. In 1933 he fled to Paris, where he commenced a slow, alcoholically induced suicide--managing, however, to write several more books, of which <i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i> was the last to appear.<p> Like so many of Roth's novels, this one is a celebration of Vienna in its pre-<i>Anschluss</i> days--during the 1870s, to be precise. "At this time," we're informed, "the world was deeply and frivolously at peace." In keeping with the frivolity, perhaps, Roth puts a fairy-tale-like spin on his memories. He opens <i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i> with a state visit by the Shah of Iran, transforming historical fact into whimsical fiction. And once he shifts the narrative to Vienna proper, his characters make their entrances and exits with brilliant, dreamlike rapidity. It would be tempting to compare the entire story--which revolves around the seduction and abandonment of the prostitute Mizzi Schinagl by the boneheaded Baron Taittinger--to a puppet show. But these puppets are capable of registering deep pain and transformation. Taittinger, for example, gets to utter the first honest sentence of his adult life: "He had caught himself telling the truth; and for the first time in many years he blushed, the way he had once blushed as a boy when he'd been caught telling a lie." And even Mizzi, the flattest character in a book full of wafer-thin ones, has her moments of electrifying humanity: </p><blockquote> She became terribly sad. Her simple soul was briefly illumined, indirectly and at a lower wattage, by the light that makes older and wiser people so happy and so sad: the light of understanding. She understood the sorrow and futility of everything. </blockquote> Roth, too, understood that sorrow. But in <i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i>, which has been beautifully translated by Michael Hofmann, he counters its gravitational pull with small, stunning perceptions and a kind of bemused decency. Indeed, Roth the novelist has precisely the "calculating kindliness" he ascribes to one Herr Efrussi--and this, he goes on to point out, is "the only sort that doesn't wreak destruction on this earth." <i>--James Marcus</i>A New York Times notable book<br> Winner of the PEN/Book-of-the-Month-Club Prize for Translation<p> "There is a poem on every page of Joseph Roth." --Joseph Brodsky</p><p> "<i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i> is sexy, highly ironic, sophisticated, and funny.... What a marvelous writer! Read him now. You can thank me later." --Michael Dirda, <i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><p> "<i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i> is an erotic fable that leads to ominous portents.... A fitting introduction to [Roth's] haunting oeuvre. Its simple, almost bouncy language, so deftly translated by Michael Hofmann, lends an uncanny air of the far away and long ago." --Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p> "[Roth's] books possess an eerie clairvoyant feel; they are shattering in their simplicity, exalting in the moral philosophical weight." --Melvin Jules Bukiet, <i>The Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p> "The totality of Joseph Roth's work is no less than a <i>tragedie humaine</i> achieved in the techniques of modern fiction." --Nadine Gordimer</p><p> "[<i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i>] is an exciting treat, a frothy fable of doom that melds comic-book Orientalism to a morality tale." --Bill Marx, <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p> "[Roth's] wonderful style...plunges us into the swim of time, so cold it feels warm, and just for a night." --Iain Bamforth, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Diane von Furstenberg&#39;s Book of Beauty: How to Become a More Attractive, Confident and Sensual Woman</h2><p>An account of the author&#39;s life and success is interwoven with specific, detailed advice on beauty and health, exercise, makeup, skin and hair care, diet, clothes, and other subjects</p><p></p><h2>Geography II, Student Text (Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Oceania, &amp; the Americas)</h2><p>Students will deepen their understanding of both the past and the present with this program.

Duke vs. North Carolina is Ali vs. Frazier, the Giants vs. the Dodgers, the Red Sox vs. the Yankees. Hell, it's bigger than that. This is the Democrats vs. the Republicans, the Yankees vs. the Confederates, capitalism vs. communism. All right, okay, the Life Force vs. the Death Instinct, Eros vs. Thanatos. Is that big enough?"</em></p><p>The basketball rivalry between Duke and North Carolina is the fiercest blood feud in college athletics. To legions of otherwise reasonable adults, it is a conflict that surpasses sports; it is locals against outsiders, elitists against populists, even good against evil. It is thousands of grown men and women with jobs and families screaming themselves hoarse at eighteen-year-old basketball geniuses, trading conspiracy theories in online chat rooms, and weeping like babies when their teams -- when <em>they</em> -- lose. In North Carolina, where both schools are located, the rivalry may be a way of aligning oneself with larger philosophic ideals -- of choosing teams in life -- a tradition of partisanship that reveals the pleasures and even the necessity of hatred.</p><p>What makes people invest their identities in what is elsewhere seen as "just a game"? What made North Carolina senator John Edwards risk alienating voters by telling a reporter, "I hate Duke basketball"? What makes people care so much?</p><p>The answers have a lot to do with class and culture in the South, and author Will Blythe expands a history of an epic grudge into an examination of family, loyalty, privilege, and Southern manners. As the season unfolds, Blythe, the former longtime literary editor of <em>Esquire</em> and a lifelong Tar Heels fan, immerses himself in the lives of the two teams, eavesdropping on practice sessions, hanging with players, observing the arcane rituals of fans, and struggling to establish some basic human kinship with Duke's players and proponents. With Blythe's access to the coaches, the stars, and the bit players, the book is both a chronicle of personal obsession and a picaresque record of social history.</p></p><p><p>Will Blythe is the former literary editor of <em>Esquire</em>. A frequent contributor to the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, he has written for the <em>New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated, Elle,</em> and the <em>Oxford American</em>, and is the editor of the acclaimed book <em>Why I Write</em>. His work has been anthologized in <em>The Best American Short Stories</em> and <em>The Best American Sportswriting</em>. He grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and now lives in New York City.</p>[Signature]Reviewed by <i>Sara Nelson</i>For a reviewer who's not all that clear on the difference between basketball and basket weaving, this book is a revelation. Former <i>Esquire</i> editor Blythe's debut is an examination of the rivalry between the University of North Carolina and Duke University college teams; in it, he interviews and profiles players and coaches, and even gives play-by-plays of key games. And yet, it is not "just" a sports book. At heart it's a memoir. Like Pat Conroy's <i>My Losing Season</i> and even Frederick Exley's <i>A Fan's Notes</i>, to which the author Anthony Wofford compares it, <i>To Hate Like This</i> is about family and passion and people and parents and aging and, oh, yeah, some sports, too.Blythe is a native North Carolinan whose UNC passion was bred in the bone; he and his siblings were raised to be genteel and polite about all things, except while watching basketball games, particularly against arch-rival Duke. After living in New York for many years, Blythe returns home as his father is dying and reflects on the passion that has shaped him and, he suggests, his region. Forget the Mason Dixon line, the real division in this border war is between Carolinians who support the Blue Devils and those who live for the Tarheels.Sports fans can expect to enjoy the accounts of particular pivotal games recounted here, but the real revelations for the relatively uninitiated are Blythe's portraits of his characters: the tough-guy coaches like Mike Krzyzewski and Dean Smith, one of whom nearly breaks down confessing that he's still in love with his ex-wife; the nurse tending Blythe's dying father; and, most of all, the father himself, the kind of personality you expect to meet in great southern novels from Harper Lee to Pat Conroy. To call <i>To Hate Like This</i> a sports book is to be only about one-third right. An elegy to place and time and generation, it is also a story of fathers and sons and an elegant testament to the way pastimes are far more than ways to pass the time. <i>(Mar. 1)</i><i>Sara Nelson is the editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly.</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Speaking in Bones,</i> the forensic anthropologist finds herself drawn into a world of dark secrets and dangerous beliefs, where good and evil blur.<br> &nbsp;<br> Professionally, Temperance Brennan knows exactly what to do&#x2014;test, analyze, identify. Her personal life is another story. She&#x2019;s at a loss, wondering how to answer police detective Andrew Ryan&#x2019;s marriage proposal. But the matter of matrimony takes a backseat when murder rears its head.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hazel &#x201c;Lucky&#x201d; Strike&#x2014;a strident amateur detective who mines the Internet for cold cases&#x2014;comes to Brennan with a tape recording of an unknown girl being held prisoner and terrorized. Strike is convinced the voice is that of eighteen-year-old Cora Teague, who went missing more than three years earlier. Strike is also certain that the teenager&#x2019;s remains are gathering dust in Temperance Brennan&#x2019;s lab.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brennan has doubts about working with a self-styled websleuth. But when the evidence seems to add up, Brennan&#x2019;s next stop is the treacherous backwoods where the chilling recording (and maybe Cora Teague&#x2019;s bones) were discovered. Her forensic field trip only turns up more disturbing questions&#x2014;along with gruesome proof of more untimely deaths.<br> &nbsp;<br> While local legends of eerie nocturnal phenomena and sinister satanic cults abound, it&#x2019;s a zealous and secretive religious sect that has Brennan spooked and struggling to separate the saints from the sinners. But there&#x2019;s nothing, including fire and brimstone, that can distract her from digging up the truth and taking down a killer&#x2014;even as Brennan finds herself in a place where angels fear to tread, devils demand their due, and she may be damned no matter what.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Speaking in Bones</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;<i>Speaking in Bones</i> keeps the suspense high.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Associated Press</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Temperance&#x2019;s forensic sleuthing uncovers many secrets, along with a blockbuster psychological surprise.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Huffington Post</i></b></p><p><b>Kathy Reichs </b>is the author of eighteen <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels and the co-author, with her son, Brendan Reichs, of six novels for young adults.

A professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, she is a former vice president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and serves on the National Police Services Advisory Council in Canada.

My wrists and ankles burn from the straps. My ribs are bruised and there&#x2019;s a lump behind my ear. I don&#x2019;t remember hitting my head. I&#x2019;m lying very still because my whole body aches. Like I&#x2019;ve been in a wreck. Like the time I crashed my bike. Why doesn&#x2019;t my family save me? Is no one missing me? I have only my family. No friends. It was just too hard. I&#x2019;m all alone. So alone. How long have I been here? Where is here? The whole world is slipping away. Everything. Everyone. Am I awake or asleep? Am I dreaming or is this real? Is it day or night?<br><br>&#x201c;When they return they will hurt me again. Why? Why is this happening to me? I can&#x2019;t hear a sound. No. That&#x2019;s not true. I can hear my heart beating. Blood working inside my ears. I taste something bitter. Probably vomit stuck in my teeth. I smell cement. My own sweat. My dirty hair. I hate when my hair isn&#x2019;t washed. I&#x2019;m gonna open my eyes now. Got one. The other&#x2019;s crusted shut. Can&#x2019;t see much. It&#x2019;s all blurry, like I&#x2019;m looking up from way down underwater.<br><br>&#x201c;I hate the waiting. That&#x2019;s when the pictures take over my brain. Not sure if they&#x2019;re memories or hallucinations. I see him. Always in black, his face crazy red and beaded with sweat. I avoid his eyes. Keep looking at his shoes. Shiny shoes. The candle flame&#x2019;s a little yellow worm dancing on the leather. He stands over me, all big and nasty. Thrusts his horrid, smelly face close to mine. I feel his icky breath on my skin. He gets mad and yanks me by the hair. His veins go all bulgy. He screams and his words sound like they&#x2019;re coming from another planet. Or like I&#x2019;ve left my body and I&#x2019;m listening from far away. I see his hand coming at me, clutching the thing so tight it quivers. I know I&#x2019;m shaking but I&#x2019;m numb. Or am I dead?<br><br>&#x201c;No! Not now! Don&#x2019;t let it happen now!<br><br>&#x201c;My hands are going all cold and tingly. I shouldn&#x2019;t be talking about him.

They were green flecked with yellow, and made me think of a cat. A cat that could bide, then pounce with deadly accuracy.<br><br>I let the silence stretch. Partly to calm my own nerves. Mostly to encourage the woman to explain the purpose of her visit. I had flight reservations in just a few hours. So much to do before heading to the airport. To Montreal and Ryan. I didn&#x2019;t need this. But I had to know the meaning of the terrible sounds I&#x2019;d just heard.<br><br>The woman remained angled forward in her chair. Tense. Expec�tant. She was tall, at least six feet, and wore boots, jeans, and a denim shirt with the cuffs rolled up her lower arms. Her hair was dyed the color of the clay at Roland Garros. She&#x2019;d yanked it into a bun high on her head.<br><br>My eyes broke free from the cat-�gaze and drifted to the wall at the woman&#x2019;s back. To a framed certificate declaring Temperance Brennan a diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Anthropology. D-�ABFA. The exam had been a bitch.<br><br>I was alone with my visitor in the 120 square feet allocated to the Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner&#x2019;s consulting forensic anthropologist. I&#x2019;d left the door open. Not sure why. Usually I close it. Something about the woman made me uneasy.<br><br>Familiar workplace sounds drifted in from the corridor. A ringing phone. A cooler door whooshing open then clicking shut. A rubber-�wheeled gurney rolling toward an autopsy suite.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; I was pleased that my voice sounded calm. &#x201c;The receptionist provided your name but I&#x2019;ve misplaced my note.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Strike. Hazel Strike.&#x201d;<br><br>That caused a little ping in my brain. What?<br><br>&#x201c;Folks call me Lucky.&#x201d;<br><br>I said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;But I never rely on luck. I work hard at what I do.&#x201d; Though I guessed Strike&#x2019;s age at somewhere north of sixty, her voice was still twenty�something strong. The accent suggested she was probably local.<br><br>&#x201c;And what is it you do, Ms. Strike?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. My husband passed six years back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He knew the risk, chose to smoke.&#x201d; Slight lift of one shoulder. &#x201c;You pay the price.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it you do?&#x201d; I repeated, wanting to draw Strike back on point.<br><br>&#x201c;Send the dead home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I match bodies to people gone missing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is the task of law enforcement in conjunction with coroners and medical examiners,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;And you pros nail it every time.&#x201d;<br><br>I bit back another priggish response. Strike had a point. Stats I&#x2019;d read put the number of missing persons in the United States at around 90,000 at any given time, the number of unidentified remains from the past fifty years at more than 40,000.

When Grace Brown is found drowned the next day in Big Moose Lake, Mattie finds that it is not as easy to burn those letters as she had thought. And, as she reads, a riveting story emerges - not only Grace Brown&#39;s story but also Mattie&#39;s hopes and ambitions for the future and her relationships with her friends and family. Published to widespread acclaim this wonderful novel, part murder mystery and part coming-of-age story, is an astounding and accomplished piece of literature. The reviews say it all...</p><p>It's 1906 and 16-year-old Mattie Gokey is at a crossroads in her life. She's escaped the overwhelming responsibilities of helping to run her father's brokedown farm in exchange for a paid summer job as a serving girl at a fancy hotel in the Adirondacks. She's saving as much of her salary as she can, but she's having trouble deciding how she's going to use the money at the end of the summer. Mattie's gift is for writing and she's been accepted to Barnard College in New York City, but she's held back by her sense of responsibility to her family--and by her budding romance with handsome-but-dull Royal Loomis. Royal awakens feelings in Mattie that she doesn't want to ignore, but she can't deny her passion for words and her desire to write. <p> At the hotel, Mattie gets caught up in the disappearance of a young couple who had gone out together in a rowboat. Mattie spoke with the young woman, Grace Brown, just before the fateful boating trip, when Grace gave her a packet of love letters and asked her to burn them. When Grace is found drowned, Mattie reads the letters and finds that she holds the key to unraveling the girl's death and her beau's mysterious disappearance. Grace Brown's story is a true one (it's the same story told in Theodore Dreiser's <i>An American Tragedy</i> and in the film adaptation, <i>A Place in the Sun</i>), and author Jennifer Donnelly masterfully interweaves the real-life story with Mattie's, making her seem even more real. </p><p> Mattie's frank voice reveals much about poverty, racism, and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century. She witnesses illness and death at a range far closer than most teens do today, and she's there when her best friend Minnie gives birth to twins. Mattie describes Minnie's harrowing labor with gut-wrenching clarity, and a visit with Minnie and the twins a few weeks later dispels any romance from the reality of young motherhood (and marriage). Overall, readers will get a taste of how bitter--and how sweet--ordinary life in the early 1900s could be. Despite the wide variety of troubles Mattie describes, the book never feels melodramatic, just heartbreakingly real.

In this first, thematic popular history of the decade, David Frum argues that it was the 1970s, not the 1960s, that created modern America and altered the American personality forever. A society that had valued faith, self-reliance, self-sacrifice, and family loyalty evolved in little more than a decade into one characterized by superstition, self-interest, narcissism, and guilt. Frum examines this metamorphosis through the rise to cultural dominance of faddish psychology, astrology, drugs, religious cults, and consumer debt, and profiles such prominent players of the decade as Werner Erhard, Alex Comfort, and Jerry Brown. <i>How We Got Here</i> is lively and provocative reading.</p><p>In a relentlessly smart book full of colorful anecdotes and deft pop-culture references, author David Frum describes the social convulsions of the 1970s: "We live in a world made new, and made new not by new machines, but by new feelings, new thoughts, new manners, new ways." The 1960s have a reputation as America's turning-point decade, but Frum convincingly argues that the 10 years following mattered more. The 1970s, he writes, "left behind a country that was more dynamic, more competitive, more tolerant; less deferential, less self-confident, less united; more socially equal, less economically equal; more expressive, more risk-averse, more sexual; less literate, less polite, less reticent." <p> The precise dates of this transformation are not as important as the reasons behind it, however, and the explanation in <i>How We Got Here</i> for what happened is both original and compelling. He says America's midcentury confidence was an anomaly. At some point, "the rebellion of an unmilitary people against institutions and laws formed by a century of war and the preparation for war" was inevitable. Rather than pondering why Americans trust their public institutions today less than they did during the Watergate revelations, for instance, Frum turns the question on its head: Why was the trust so high previous to that experience? His narrative describing the dizzy whirl of progress is absorbing, and his warning against both the nostalgic myths of the past and the uncritical acceptance of recent change is wise. <i>How We Got Here</i> also has a perfect title: there may not be a better book available on the broad currents of American social life in the second half of the 20th century. <i>--John J.

After they both try and fail, the badger departs in disgrace and the fox falls in love with the monk. When she learns that his life is in danger, she calls upon the King of All Night's Dreaming to help her save his life. If the story sounds familiar, that's because this book retells Gaiman's 1999 award-winning novella as a graphic novel. While the original story was illustrated with breathtaking watercolors by Yoshitaka Amano, this new adaptation looks more like the rest of the original "Sandman" series. It is divided into panels, characters speak in word balloons, and the artwork (especially that of the fox) is more cartoonlike. There are several advantages to this new approach&#x2014;readers can see the characters and the action in better detail, the graphic-novel format may attract reluctant readers, and readers get to see Dream speak in his white-on-black word balloons again. But the disadvantage of this version is that its presence eclipses the awe-inspiring beauty of Amano's work. <i>The Dream Hunters</i> is equally powerful as straight text or broken up into panels, but hopefully readers will be inspired by this book to seek out the earlier version (which thankfully is still in print) and enjoy another interpretation of the artwork for this story.&#x2014;<i>Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dzielska shows us why versions of Hypatia's legend have served her champions' purposes, and how they have distorted the true story. She takes us back to the Alexandria of Hypatia's day, with its Library and Museion, pagan cults and the pontificate of Saint Cyril, thriving Jewish community and vibrant Greek culture, and circles of philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, and militant Christians. Drawing on the letters of Hypatia's most prominent pupil, Synesius of Cyrene, Dzielska constructs a compelling picture of the young philosopher's disciples and her teaching. Finally she plumbs her sources for the facts surrounding Hypatia's cruel death, clarifying what the murder tells us about the tensions of this tumultuous era. </p></p><p>Hypatia--brilliant mathematician, eloquent Neoplatonist, and a woman renowned for her beauty--was brutally murdered by a mob of Christians in Alexandria in 415.

Hannah Wilke&#39;s artwork, like her life, frames a heroic story about formal invention and social activism, personal loyalties and individual freedom, and, above all, breathtaking risk. A defining presence in the emerging community of women artists in the 1960s and 70s, Wilke developed a unique and controversial visual language in response to her own and women s experience. An unapologetic individualist, she celebrated her relationships with men as well as women and frankly explored the pleasures of sexuality. Using a wide range of nontraditional mediums, including latex and chewing gum as well as photography and film, she irreverently paid tribute to predecessors from Marcel Duchamp to David Smith. Focusing on the body as instrument and object of visual expression, Wilke made her art an unremitting self-exploration without false modesty (when her naked body was an uncomplicated delight to behold) or shame (when it was mercilessly blighted by cancer). Wilke&#39;s art is inseparable from Wilke the person bold, sometimes outrageous, and, ultimately, heartbreakingly courageous.</p><p>Hannah Wilke (1940-1993) was a defining presence in the community of women artists who emerged in the 1960s, determined to expose (and fix) the inequities of the fast-growing art world. She developed a bold visual language responsive to female experience; at the same time she was an unapologetic individualist who celebrated in her work her relationships with men as well as women and frankly explored the pleasures of sexuality. Using a wide range of unconventional media, including latex and chewing gum as well as photography and film, she paid tribute to predecessors like Marcel Duchamp with humorous irreverence. Her key concern was the body as instrument and object of visual expression; Wilke was most boldly honest in an unremitting self-exploration that she undertook without false modesty (when her naked body was an uncomplicated delight to behold) or shame (when it was mercilessly blighted by cancer). The first monograph to comprehensively survey Wilke's artistic career, this book celebrates the achievement of a pioneering and provocative artist whose controversial and ultimately deeply moving work is now being recognized.<br>Born in New York in 1940, Hannah Wilke grew up in New York City and suburban Long Island, and received a B.F.A. from the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia in 1962. By the middle 1960s, she had begun making vaginally shaped sculptures, mostly in ceramic, that ranged from raw to elegant. Developing this imagery throughout her career as a feminist statement and also out of interest in its formal possibilities, she went on to explore similarly sensual abstract forms in latex wall sculptures of the 1970s. A pioneer of video and performance art. Wilke staged events in which her own body, often mostly or entirely unclothed, became the vehicle of some of her most radical provocations. Her mother's illness with cancer, followed by her own, dramatically changed the direction of Willke's work, adding a disturbing and powerful dimension to her achievement.

All of us -- people of color and white people alike -- are damaged by its debilitating effects. In this book, the author addresses the &#34;majority,&#34; the white race in the United States. Racism permeates the individual attitudes and behavior of white people, but even more seriously, it permeates public systems, institutions, and culture. This book does not intend to attack or to produce guilt, but its message is tough and demanding. It begins by analyzing racism as it is today and the ways it has changed or not changed over the past few decades. Most important, the book focuses on the task of dismantling racism, how we can work to bring it to an end and build a racially just, multiracial, and multicultural society. Churches are not strangers to the task of combating racism, but so much of what we have done is too little, too late. We have yet to make a serious impact in the racism that surrounds us and is within us. This book calls us to begin our next assault on the demonic evil of racism. The result that it seeks is freedom for all races, all people.</p><p>Joseph Barndt is a pastor in the Bronx in New York City and co-director of Crossroads, a ministry working to dismantle racism and build a multicultural church and society.

Friends and family members often offer comfort with &#x201c;Everything happens for a reason&#x201d;&#x2014;a simple, common phrase with an unbearably elusive meaning. <br><br>In <b>Everything Happens for a Reason</b>, psychotherapist Mira Kirshenbaum helps us understand the principles behind this frequently used phrase and provides us with tools to grasp its true meaning. According to Kirshenbaum, there is significance to each of the events in our lives. We all can discover meaning in what has happened to us&#x2014;seeing such occurrences as gifts, lessons, or opportunities that we might not have been able to get any other way. Building on more than twenty-five years of clinical research, Kirshenbaum has developed tests to help readers decode the confusing or unfortunate events in their lives and find solace and strength in the positive outcomes that exist. <br><br>Kirshenbaum offers ten universal reasons for the tragedies in our lives, among them letting go of fear, radically accepting ourselves, becoming a truly good person, finding forgiveness, and discovering our mission. <br><br>While coming to terms with unexpected loss and disappointment is never easy, <b>Everything Happens for a Reason </b>empowers readers to embrace the positive and comprehend the specific message that is larger and more powerful than their grief.</p><p>MIRA KIRSHENBAUM is a psychotherapist and researcher and the clinical director of the Chestnut Hill Institute in Boston, where she has practiced for twenty-five years. She is the author of six previous books, including the influential <b>Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay</b> and <b>Parent/Teen Breakthrough</b>.Is it really true that everything happens for a reason? After all, that's an amazing thing to say&#x2014;that no matter what happens to you, not only does something valuable come out of it but it's just what you need. <br><br>Amazing as it sounds, it is true. It's taken me a long time, but I now see that even in the worst disaster&#x2014;and I've had my share&#x2014;there are wonderful gifts, hidden opportunities, or life-enhancing lessons. And we couldn't have gotten them any other way. If someone as hardheaded as I am can come to understand this, anyone can. <br><br>Of course, sometimes it's easy for us to believe that everything happens for a reason. We see it in little ways, like when our plans for an evening out fall through at the last minute, and we discover that everything we really want is at home that night anyway. <br><br>And sometimes we see it in not-so-little ways. A woman I know wrenched her back and had to spend a month in bed. She felt this was the last thing she needed in her life, particularly since it happened at a time when she had to make some important decisions. And then it hit her&#x2014;this was exactly what she needed. Her old habit had been to rush impetuously into a new decision without thinking it through. Now it was as if life were saying, "If you won't give yourself time to think, I will." <br><br>We very much want to believe that the things that happen to us have great meaning. It's the way we feel life should be. Yes, some days we feel our life's a soap opera. But we want&#x2014;we need&#x2014;to have the sense that there's a purpose and value to it all. And we're right. <br><br>I want to reassure you: When you discover the true meaning of the events in your life, everything changes.<br><br>You feel stronger because your sense that everything has meaning gives you great confidence. <br><br>You feel wiser because you see how everything connects. <br><br>You're more in touch with who you are because you know that you're living the life you were meant to lead. <br><br>And you're happier because you're able to put your loss behind you and have a sense of a future filled with good things. <br><br>Until you get to this place, nothing is going to feel right. Let's say you're outdoors and you suddenly feel a drop of moisture fall on your head. You're not going to be able to think of anything else until you figure out why that happened. Is water dripping from some air conditioner up high? Is it starting to rain? Is a flying monkey peeing on your head? You have to know why that drop of moisture fell on your head because you can't feel safe going forward until you do. <br><br>We need to know why much more when what fell on our heads is a catastrophe. If you can't make sense of the catastrophe, it's as if your life is mere dice on a crap table&#x2014;if nothing has any meaning, everything's random, anything can happen. <br><br>It's painful to live not knowing why you got so sick that time or why you lost the love of your life&#x2014;much more painful than people suspect. One woman I know was flying home for Thanksgiving when she was in college. As the plane was flying along twenty thousand feet in the air, she developed a terrible earache. But that's not what made her cry. In the dark of a nighttime flight she was sobbing because there was pain like this in the world, seemingly without any rhyme or reason. <br><br>One guy described this feeling differently: "When I think about the bad stuff that's happened in my life, I feel I'm just a goddamn fool of the cosmos. It's humiliating! On a sidewalk crowded with people, I'm the one who's stepped in the dog poop. No one else is as stupid or unlucky as I am. The problem is: How can I go forward, how can I trust the future if I feel I am this stupid unlucky guy?" <br><br>Knowing that there's a reason for what happens also saves us from being filled with blame. Blame is a very human attempt to make sense of some catastrophe, but most of the time we hate the way it feels. And yet when something bad happens to us, it's almost a reflex to think, It's because everyone hates me, because I'm a loser, because I'm doomed. And so the blame begins. <br><br>We blame other people, and then we end up with the sense that the world is full of bad people. We blame ourselves, and then instead of feeling healthy, strong, and whole we see ourselves as sick, weak, and broken. And we blame life itself. What could be more demoralizing than feeling condemned to having bad things always happen to us and not being able to do anything about it?<br><br>Blame is like a boomerang that loops around and bonks us on the noggin. Try this yourself: If you see someone struggling with sadness, anxiety, and negativity, listen to his story. You'll soon see he's living in a world where all he sees are things to blame because he lives without positive meanings for what's happened to him. The only cure is to restore the sense that there is a good reason for everything that happens. <br><br>Explain That, Why Don't You?<br><br>Years ago, if you'd said to me, "Everything happens for a reason," I'd have said that was a lot of bull. Things happened in my life that were so painful it's no wonder I'd had trouble finding their meaning, and I gave up looking. I now know that was a big mistake. <br><br>Lots of things happen to us that challenge our sense that everything happens for a reason. It can be anything. You get seriously ill at the worst possible moment. You think you've found the love of your life but something goes haywire between you and now the two of you are over. You've had one of those really painful childhoods. You screw up and lose a lot of money. Someone you love dies. <br><br>Yeah, we think, maybe there's a meaning for some things that happen, but not for this. <br><br>And even if we still have a shred of faith left that there is meaning in these events, we don't know how to find it. After all, the events in our lives don't come to us with labels attached telling us what they mean. We can spend years searching in vain. We ask friends, but they haven't gone through what we have. We ask someone who has gone through something similar, but that person is probably struggling to find meaning, too. <br><br>At some point we might be tempted to give up the search. That's what happened to me. It took one of my patients to wake me up and give me the hope that we can discover the meaning of the events in our lives. Everything important I've learned about how to do my job I've learned from my patients. Scott* was one of my best "teachers."<br><br>The Message in the Bottle<br><br>We all have dreams of what we'd like to do with our lives. When Scott first came to see me many years ago he was dreaming about going back to school and becoming a landscape designer. But he was afraid to give up his well-paying job. As you can imagine, addressing underlying issues of anxiety, low self-esteem, and identity played an important role in our work together. Soon, though, our work was all about helping him get what he needed to make his dream come true. He ultimately completed a two-year program at an excellent school and eventually opened his own little landscape-design business. He felt fulfilled.<br><br>Several years later Scott came back to work with me. Sadly, he had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and he thought he was dying. (Scott's cancer eventually went into remission. He's still okay.) He said he wanted to discover why this terrible disease had happened to him just when his life was starting to work out. "Isn't this really a theological question?" I asked Scott. Truthfully, I didn't want to deal with a question like this. My attitude at that time was that you could never find an answer. And anyway, the most important thing is to make the best use of the time you have remaining. Why ask why?<br><br>But Scott, bless him, held onto his need. He was about to teach me an important lesson about how helping people is ultimately about helping them find meaning. After I'd dismissed his question Scott looked at me with tears in his eyes as if I'd betrayed him and said, "You don't understand. I don't want to die feeling like I was just some squirrel that got run over on the highway of life&#x2014;hey, man, bad luck. I know that I'm not just a victim of a game of chance. I can't believe that I live in a universe where the things that happen to us don't have any meaning. There is some meaning in this, a message in a bottle for me. The message feels just out of reach, but it's very important to me. Help me get that message."<br><br>Somehow that got through to me. I remembered how much I, too, had wanted to get that message back when I was a kid. (In a few moments I'll tell you about all the things that had happened to me and my family that left me hungry to find some kind of meaning and how discouraged I got when I didn't think I could find any.) Looking in Scott's eyes, I lost my sense of being pissed off at the universe because the things that happen to us don't come neatly labeled with their true meanings. Scott's need reawakened my own and all the hopes that came with it. I'd thought my need for meaning was dead. I'd acted as if it were dead. But the utter genuineness and validity of Scott's need made me realize that my own need for meaning had never died. Suddenly I felt a whole new connection to Scott, to my younger self, and to a world of people who were hungry to feel that what happens to them has meaning. <br><br>There was just one problem: How in the world could I help Scott discover why he'd gotten sick and might die if I couldn't help myself? I found myself terribly moved as I told him that I saw how this situation should have meaning and then confessed that I didn't know how to help him find that meaning. I felt I'd failed him. And I felt terrible about it. But I made a promise to myself that I would learn how to help people find the true meanings of the events in their lives. <br><br>Scott called several months later. He obviously wasn't as disappointed in me as I was in myself. I guess we all know how tough this search is. He had a note of triumph in his voice. <br><br>"I know why I got sick!" he said. "Look at where I was in my life. I'd made a lot of progress, but I was still frightened of so many things&#x2014;flying, confrontations, bad news, you name it. Here's the gift getting sick gave me. Every day I'm learning not to be afraid, big-time. Death is the big confrontation. Once you face death, how can you be afraid of, like, someone rejecting you? You know, it's true: Cowards die a thousand deaths, heroes die but once. I'd rather live a short life without fear than the living death of a long life filled with fear.<br><br>"And I wouldn't have discovered any of this if I hadn't gotten sick. I don't know how much time I have left to live, but in the time I have left I'm feeling more alive and less afraid than I ever did before."<br><br>Everyone who survives something feels they have a new lease on life. But Scott felt he had a new lease on life even when he thought he was dying. Understanding that there was meaning in what was happening to him, discovering what that meaning was, made all the difference for him. <br><br>It made all the difference for me, too.<br>A Voyage of Discovery<br><br>That was the beginning of my own voyage of discovery. Wow, I thought, it really changes everything if you can discover the reason why some life event has overtaken you. But I was still skeptical&#x2014;I was far from convinced that Scott had discovered the real reason why he'd gotten sick or if a real reason could be discovered. But it had meaning for him, and as a therapist, I had to take this seriously. Just imagine, I thought, if I could help other people discover what Scott was lucky enough to discover. . . . <br><br>Deep down, of course, I knew how badly I needed this myself. <br><br>My Story<br><br>I'm sure I've had more than my share of blessings. I've been happily married for a long time. I have two great kids. I have good friends. Over the years it's been my privilege to help hundreds of thousands of people, and I love my work. So maybe you're wondering, "Hey, what does Mira know about what it's like to go through something really bad?" Good question. <br><br>I grew up with loss baked in my bones. As a child of Holocaust survivors, I lost the entire world in which I was supposed to grow up. Yeah, my parents survived. But everyone else in my family was killed: my mother's seven brothers and sisters, my father's five, all four of my grandparents. <br><br>I also lost the early years of my childhood. I was smuggled across Europe at the bottom of a hay wagon. I almost died of dysentery when I was three months old. I lived in a refugee camp for the first four years of my life. A barracks full of grown-ups recovering from shattered lives doesn't make for a good-time nursery school.<br><br>When I was four my life again turned upside down and inside out. I lost my father and my sister&#x2014;my parents had gotten divorced and my father and my sister disappeared from my life. Then I left the only world I'd known, the refugee camp, to come to America. <br><br>When I arrived in New York I was so skinny that one of my distant relatives burst into tears when he saw me. My mother went to work in a clothing factory, and I had to take care of my brother. She eventually remarried, but my stepfather was no bargain. And we were poor&#x2014;I didn't get a new dress until I was ten, and I bought it for myself with the money I'd earned baby-sitting.</p><h2>Pat Nixon: The Untold Story</h2><p>This portrait follows the former First Lady from her birth in a boomtown mining shack to the White House and is full of anecdotes and behind-the-scenes glimpses of historical figures</p><p>No surprises here. Julie finds her mother devoted, loyal, thrifty, courageousa remarkable woman whose "grit" kept her going from her struggling student days in the Depression through the vicissitudes of political life to the nightmare of Watergate. Julie's sincere affection and admiration for her mother are the most attractive features of this otherwise lackluster book. Ironically, even in her daughter's hands Pat Nixon remains the quintessential political wife, fading into the background as events overtake the Presidency and her biography slips into a apologia for Nixon's political career. Julie remains her father's most spirited defender: Haldeman isolated him, Dean lied about him, and the press victimized him. Nixon supporters will find this valentine of a book reassuring, but everyone else will look in vain for the "untold truth." Like the close-knit family scenes the author is fond of describing, the book is cozy, respectable and dull.

These are the first new Modesty stories in 11 years, and they span her career, from the early days of running the Network, to her shadowy work for British Intelligence. From Tangier, to the Pyrenees, to a South American jungle&#x2014;Modesty and her trusted lieutenant Willie Garvin dispatch an old nemesis, upset a particularly wicked gang of kidnappers, and risk their lives to rescue old friends from certain death. The skill and nerve that Modesty and her accomplices display in combat and under pressure will delight Modesty fans, both new and old.<br></p><p><b>Peter O'Donnell</b> created the Modesty Blaise strip cartoon in the 1950s and is the author of the entire Modesty Blaise novel series.<br>It's taken five years for this 13th and final Modesty Blaise cult classic to reach American shores, and fans who have followed the action-packed exploits of the lethal crime-fighting team of femme fatale Blaise and her knife-wielding partner, Willie Garvin, will not be disappointed with this collection of five short stories. O'Donnell's immensely satisfying farewell to the team (which originated in a 1963 comic strip and the 1965 novel Modesty Blaise) spans Modesty's entire career, thus serving as a fitting introduction to newcomers and satisfying retrospective for fans. "The Bellman" finds Modesty and Willie being hunted on a deserted island by three assassins. In "The Dark Angels," the two protect an oilman from a team of acrobatic killers. "Old Alex," a direct sequel to the novel Dead Man's Handle, mixes an amnesia tale with a fight to the death with the industrial spy group Salamander Four. "The Girl with the Black Balloon" is a devilishly clever kidnapping/rescue caper. And the final, title story features a 52-year-old Modesty, long retired but back in action to save friends from a South American uprising. Often called a female James Bond and certainly the first of the breed Modesty never lapses into self-parody and her illegal capers are governed by a moral code never crossed. Emphasizing hand-to-hand combat over automatic weapons, the octogenarian author still dazzles with exciting action, surprising twists and refreshing humor. His heroine will be missed (until her adventures are brought back into print).

This book describes how model steam engines work, outlines the development of the machine tools used to build the models, and investigates the seven different categories of model engines, which include models built to support patent applications, and those built purely for pleasure. <br><br>The author, himself a model steam locomotive driver, also delves into the possible pitfalls and practicalities of scale model engineering. Generously illustrated, this is guaranteed to interest any aspiring engineer, as well as collectors of steam engines.</p><p>Bob Gordon trained as an engineer and has an abiding passion for the power and motion of steam engines. Over the years this has been enhanced by working with steam engines ashore, serving on steam-powered ships afloat, operating model steam engines and driving model steam locomotives.

Frequently focusing on animals, his strikingly realistic yet dreamlike images reveal nature&#x2019;s beauty and fragility, as well as Drochon&#x2019;s profound concern over its destruction. As he creates, we watch the progression from initial sketches done outdoors from life&#x2019; to painstaking studio work. Examples in a range of media showcase the different ways he captures a big cat&#x2019;s baleful gaze, a macaw&#x2019;s luminous plumage, and the ominous peace of a slumbering polar bear. Fran�oise Coffrant supplies illuminating, authoritative commentary.</p><p>Christophe Drochon&#39;s beautiful paintings demonstrate the mastery of a hyper-realistic technique that will delight and fascinate fans of nature. In his paintings, the animal and the scenery are often used as symbols to express ideas, and to illustrate emotional events in his personal life. Through his painting, Drochon hopes to inspire an awareness of the fragility of the world. Many of his paintings focus on the eyes of the animal, and with these astonishingly intimate portraits, he allows us to glimpse the soul of the natural world, and in the process, brings us closer to an understanding of ourselves.</p><h2>The Life You Were Born to Live</h2><p>A guide to the 37 pathways of life and how to find yours.</p><p>To our readers: The books we publish are our contribution to an emerging world based on cooperation rather than on competition, on affirmation of the human spirit rather than on self-doubt, and on the certainty that all humanity is connected.

It was a poster of the Brooklyn Bridge at night, the city lit up like the Fourth of July behind it and in the bottom right corner a dimly lit riverfront street I didn't know. The poster took up half the width of my bedroom wall at my home in southern Missouri. To me it represented everything my rural community south of St. Louis did not: excitement, adventure, opportunity, sophistication. Everything I knew about New York came from The Baby-Sitters Club: Stacey's Mistake (No.18). I wanted to picnic in Central Park. I wanted to see the museums and eat lox and bagels. But when I visited Manhattan for the first time, my childhood dream was shattered, because no matter how large my poster was, it couldn't convey the size of the city. I felt like the buildings were long fingers clasping over me, and I couldn't see the wide-open sky. It was pointless to drive a car anywhere, and the first time I tried to relax in Central Park two homeless people fought in front of me and everywhere smelled like urine and pretzels. The childhood Dana took down that Brooklyn Bridge poster from her mind's bedroom wall.<br><br> I never realized my attachment to that wide-open Flyover sky until I had to do without it. As much as I wanted to love and fall in love with NYC, I couldn't. My very first visit to the city left me overwhelmed. I was in town to appear on Wendy Williams's television show. The staff was wonderful and gracious; they put me up at the W in midtown, and some band booked on Jimmy Fallon's late-night show played me to sleep in Times Square. There were so many people and so many things and advertisements and cars and noise that I went to Sbarro, got a slice of pizza, and holed up in my room for the rest of the day watching the city parade past, many stories up, through the glass. I got more adventurous with every visit, although my views of the city were mainly limited to what I could see through the tinted windows of a studio-hired car en route to this or that network. I've been to NYC more times than I can count at this point, but every time I go I take a big breath as the bridge dumps me out of Queens and into Manhattan. I also can't sleep without a white-noise machine that plays crickets and frogs.<br><br> My childhood was fraught with upheaval, a tempestuous childhood of domestic violence that resulted in a struggling single-parent household in Flyover. My mother worked in the city because the jobs were in the city, not in the rolling hills and green pastures of the rural farmland where she and the rest of my family originated and still live. I was angry at her for having us live so far from everyone we knew. I hated my elementary school and the kids who didn't like me: I was small for my age, reed thin, and unremarkable in every way. From my mother's feminist, leftist perspective, in rural America you were either a wife, a waitress, or a bank teller at the small branch in town-or you got lucky and scored a job as a makeup artist for the local mortician, as my mother's best friend did after high school. The city offered more opportunities for employment (for her) and education (for me). Every weekend we'd make the two-and-a-half hour journey back to "the country," as we simply called it, the nouveau city mice visiting the country mice. Every weekend my spirit was restored in a tiny one-room church, playing in the creek with my cousins, catching fireflies at dusk, and sleeping at the foot of my grandparents' woodstove as the sound of crickets lulled me to sleep; in the winter it was the sound of complete silence from the woods buried in snow. Nothing was ever so wonderful as being in the Ozarks. My cousins were cared for after school by my aunts, older cousins, and Grandmother. They grew up spending every day, not just weekends and summers, playing in the creek, picking corn, naming Grandpa's goats, chasing Grandma's pheasants when she wasn't looking. Their caregivers consisted of familiar places, familiar locations.<br><br> Everyone in the family knew where each grandkid was at any given point in the day. My cousins had one another at school during the day. If you messed with one, you messed with all. They attended one another's basketball and volleyball games; they cheered wildly whenever a cousin made a basket or scored a point. They rooted for one another at the town's annual beauty pageant and gathered at Grandma and Grandpa's beforehand to dress that year's appointed female cousin in the best gown and makeup the Ozarks had to offer. They attended church together and sat next to one another, filling up half the pews in the sanctuary. If you didn't have a father figure in your life there was Grandpa, a bevy of uncles, and older cousins there to fill the role. Everyone always had a partner at recess, company at dinner, a shoulder on which to cry, a hand to hold, a ride from school. They were separated from me by hours of asphalt and rolling hills.<br><br> In the city, no one knew who I was or to whom I belonged. An endless string of teenage girls babysat me after school. I felt no particular attachment to any of them. One time one of them forgot to make me lunch and instead made out with her boyfriend on my mom's bed. I turned up the television so Heathcliff would drown out their noises and then ran outside and down the steps to the sidewalk in front of our house, where I sat on the bottom step and embraced my knees. There was no one to whom I could run. I had no tribe. The neighbors on our left were a poor family whose daughter smoked pot and whose bedroom consisted of a mattress and rainbow curtains; her parents fought at night and I could hear her mother's every scream. The neighbors to our right were a family who seemed to find themselves in our hovelly hood due to hard times, and they kept to themselves. My mother did the best she could for me. I hid the transgressions of babysitters so that she wouldn't worry while she slaved away at one of the three jobs she worked so we could avoid taking government handouts.<br><br> No one knew me at school. I didn't fit in with the preps, the burnouts, the jocks; I didn't even fit in with the weirdos, which made me the weirdest weirdo of all. I ate lunch alone and pretended that people at my school who remotely looked like me were family members. I sat on the bus alone and no one noticed me. Literally. One day I forgot to get off at my stop and was too small for the driver to see. My mom and the school found me a couple of hours later, crying in my seat in the dark bus shed. It's amazing how you can feel lonelier in a city than in the country. In the city you're isolated by all of the nameless faces and the noise of their conversations. Everyone around you does what you do, so no one stands apart.<br><br> During recess I swung. It was a solo activity. I would swing higher and higher until I could look down the hill at the long drive that led up to my elementary school. I'd imagine my mom's green Oldsmobile coming up that windy drive to collect me early from school and take me away back down south to our family. Every Friday that's what she did: She picked me up after school and we'd escape. We'd eat sandwiches, or if I was lucky, I'd eat a McDonald's Happy Meal in the car. There wasn't time to stop and eat anywhere; Mom wanted to be on the road and get to the country as badly as I did. I'd hand her fries while she drove. We'd chase the last stretch of sunbeams across the plains until the white lines on the highway were all I could see. I'd drift off to sleep and wouldn't wake up until I could hear the crunch of Grandma and Grandpa's gravel drive under the well-worn tires of our thirdhand car.<br><br> Waking up on Saturday morning at Grandma and Grandpa's was magical. Sometimes I would be so tired that I'd sleep through the rooster's crow, but Grandma's bacon and eggs would wake me up every time. I'd get out of bed and make my way down the hall to their sun-drenched living room. I'd hug Grandpa first because he was always in his recliner, watching wrestling and drinking coffee.<br><br> "Are they treating you nice up there?" he'd always ask. I'd always answer yes, even if it wasn't true. I think he knew when it wasn't, but Grandpa never pried. He was selectively half deaf from firing .50 caliber guns on the USS Alabama during World War II. He would pretend not to hear you when he didn't want to but always amazed us with what he would hear and inquire about later. After Grandpa, I'd find Grandma in the kitchen and hang on her waist while she fried eggs. My grandmother was a micromanaging matriarch with a terrible temper, but no one fiercely loved and protected their brood like this woman did. She would kiss my head and tell me that she'd made sure to fill the cookie jar before we arrived. Mom would sit at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette while Grandma cooked. Mom would brief Grandma on everything during those Saturday mornings when I slept in: her divorce, her work, my school, how we were doing. After breakfast we dressed, and then by noon the entire family would descend on my grandparents' house. It was a Saturday tradition. The adults would visit and we kids would tear loose throughout the hills and valleys around Grandma and Grandpa's property.<br><br> Where I lived was very different from the country, where the Quik Mart owner, canoe rental proprietor, gas station attendant, town preacher, and everyone else recognized me without even hearing my family name, all because I had the family looks: dark hair, large dark eyes, olive skin, and a slender build.<br><br> "I know you. You're Gale's daughter," one would say. "You look just like all of 'em."<br><br> "Well, I'll be," said another. "You're the spittin' image of 'em all." They'd watch me and my cousins with amusement as we'd walk into the store barefoot, fresh from the creek, and pick up Sixlets and cream sodas before unfurling damp, wadded-up dollars on the counter to pay for them. There's a certain credit you carry when everyone knows your family. In the city your family name means nothing to anyone. Down here, down in these dark crevices of the Missouri hills, it means inclusion, belonging, familiarity, legacy. Family isn't perfect. You can't unfriend family; you can't unfollow them. They are yours. They are mine. And I know in my soul that if ever I found myself in a situation, my family would be there, just as I would be for them. My cousin once heard about threats I'd received and messaged me that he would "come to the city and sit on your porch with my shotgun." I cried for an hour straight. My Flyover family. They were bred for the woods, for the prairies, bred to live off nature, to fight, and to love. They live in one of the most beautiful parts of the United States, a place people don't see unless they look down from their plane windows at thirty thousand feet.<br><br> Aside from faith, name, looks, and mannerisms, I shared something else with my family: their politics. The stereotype is that country bumpkins are just one big Republican voting bloc. They've never met my family. I've said before that Bill Clinton was the second man after my father to screw me over, and it started me down a path of political self-discovery. My faith and my politics are intertwined because, you see, one led me to the other. It was my biggest vulnerability that drove me to God and to a deeper understanding of self-sustainability and responsibility.<br><br> I came from a broken home. I am a statistic in that regard. I had a horrible relationship with my father that followed me into my adulthood and nearly killed me spiritually. The entire first half of my life was tainted by its effect on me. I allowed it to control me. I hated men, I hated marriage, I never wanted children, and I believed that the only good place for a woman to be was on her own. I was rude to men, I was cruel to boys I dated, I was angry at the world, and I felt that the entire universe owed me a giant apology. I was uncomfortable in the homes of friends who had intact families. It didn't help that I had friends whose parents viewed me as damaged goods because I had a single mom at home. They went to big churches and prayed to God, but I didn't see any fruits of their faith in their hushed tones and condescending looks whenever my mother would collect me from their house in her old car. I resented them, I resented their faith, and I resented their wealth. I resented that they always had family in the stands cheering them on at track meets while it was rare for someone to be there for me. I raged at God in prayer.<br><br> Why did I get the shaft, God?! I would mentally scream. Why did you do this to me? I thought you were omnipotent! He just took it. He took all of it. Over the period of a few years He began to soften my heart (a child's heart!) to the point where I could open a Bible and read it. And I did. The first Bible I read was the giant Bible my grandma and grandpa kept on their coffee table. Some people keep art books or magazines on their coffee tables, but at my grandparents' house they kept a giant Bible. It was in a wooden box specially made for them by a cousin in shop class. Every now and then I saw Grandpa reading through it. (We later learned, after Grandpa got sick, that he hated banks and kept a sizable amount of money in his Bible. His reasoning was that "no heathen is going to take it.") I picked it up one weekend and spent an entire night reading the Gospels. That's how my journey began. I went to Sunday school and church with my grandma, aunts, and assorted cousins. It was a tiny little Baptist church in the hills with three rooms: one for worship and two classrooms for adults and kids in the basement. My family aren't what I'd call "holy rollers," but Grandpa would crack you with some Scripture when needed. It was from this that I asked my mom to start taking me to church. Mom picked up another job on certain weekends, so whenever she couldn't drive south she'd take me to church near our house. From there I attended church camp and was saved. The absence of a father figure in my life had created an abyss in my heart so deep that I almost couldn't function. Without even realizing what I was doing, I began seeking out a way to fill it and through this pain found my faith. I may not have had an earthly father, but I have a Father in heaven. I was saved at a country Baptist church camp when I was eleven. I am still growing in my faith to this day. It has not been without bumps along the way, particularly during my teenage years, but it has been my relationship with Christ alone that has brought me to where I am now.</p><h2>Phantoms of the Hudson Valley: The Glorious Estates of a Lost Era</h2><p>These stately mansions recall the aristocratic luxury of a bygone era, with their turrets and spires, rambling porticos, gleaming columns, and glaring gargoyles. Through her masterful photography and darkroom work, Randall has created some of the restles</p><p>A stunning architectural tour of 28 abandoned estates that loom as mysterious ruins along the Hudson River between New York City and Albany. Many of the now-faded mansions were designed by Stanford White, the premier architect of New York&#39;s gilded age, and were owned by such illustrious families as the Vanderbilts, Astors, and Whitneys. The author&#39;s evocative, sepia-tinted photos capture the architectural splendor of these once luxurious homes, as well as the ravages of time, from the houses&#39; crumbling turrets and spires, porticos, columns, gargoyles, and weed-choked courtyards and gazebos, to their interior vaulted ceilings, spacious ballrooms, and huge, empty libraries. Paired with ghost stories and legends about the estates, this book is a haunting reminder of a bygone era and lifestyle.Monica Randall&#39;s evocative, sepia-tinted photographs capture the architectural splendor of twenty-eight palatial estates - some of them truly castles - that loom as mysterious ruins along the Hudson River. Through her masterful photography and darkroom work, Randall also recreates some of the restless phantoms she learned about while interviewing the current owners. These stately mansions, many of them among the most historically significant in the country, recall the aristocratic luxury of a bygone era, with their turrets and spires, rambling porticos, gleaming columns, glaring gargoyles, and, inside, vaulted ceilings, spacious ballrooms, huge libraries that reflect the river elite&#39;s obsession for books, and endless personal touches that are the indulgences of the wealthy. Bannerman&#39;s Castle, a once-magnificent Scottish-styled fortress, now abandoned for half a century, is perhaps the most breathtaking sight on the river; the abandoned Victorian villa Wyndcliff is a savage display of ruin and decay - these and all the rest hold their secrets in deserted attics, hidden passageways and weed-choked gazebos. Many of the houses were photographed by Monica Randall shortly before being razed; this book provides a lasting record of their former glory. Also included are spectacular Edgewater, once owned by Gore Vidal, and the magnificent Wilderstein, now a museum, which was home to Daisy Suckley, whose love letters to and from Franklin Roosevelt were recently discovered there. The mansions represent the prize work of the renowned architects of the day - Stanford White, Alexander Jackson Davis, Carrere and Hastings, and William Welles Bosworth - and were home to such legendary American familiesas the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Warners, and Payne-Whitneys. Pairing the visual spectacle of the mansions of the Hudson with the tales of phantoms that haunt them, Monica Randall celebrates the glamour and mystery of these glorious old estates.</p><h2>Timeless Voices, Timeless Themes: California Edition Copper Level</h2><p>2002 Prentice Hall Literature: Timeless Voices, Timeless Themes Grade 6 Copper Level California Edition (CA)(H) by Kate Kinsella, Kevin Feldman, Colleen Shea Stump, Joyce Armstrong Carroll, &amp; Edward E.

Other works include Couriers, Demo, Local and Supermarket. He has earned multiple Eisner Award nominations, and his work has been published in close to a dozen foreign markets.Readers might assume that they're watching a report from Baghdad as they see a suicide bomber massacring a ragged urban crowd gathered for a clean water distribution in this dark political satire. Actually, the scene is New York City, front line in a full-scale civil war between Free States rebels and the U.S. government. The main focus is Matty Roth, a kid who thought he was entering the city as mere assistant to a veteran reporter but who now finds himself an agonizingly "embedded journalist" with more power and responsibilities than he ever wanted. For Matty and readers, there's no longer any safe distance from the violence. At the same time, however, the residents of the DMZ feel unexpected, growing satisfaction at what they can do now that they've been violently freed from a government's sham protection, with only themselves to rely on. Wood's scripts present the characters' mingled pain and hope well, but Burchielli's outstanding art really sells the story by intensifying familiar urban grunge into a Third &#x2013;World&#x2013;like battle zone. He has a good sense of the city as a sniper-haunted landscape, from deserted streets to a maimed Statue of Liberty. This book is a disturbing, challenging success. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After all, new cadets arriving at the military academy are not required to pack anything more than a toothbrush and some underwear since they will be issued everything else. But despite their uniformity and disciplined bearing, the cadets profiled in David Lipsky's <i>Absolutely American</i> are still college kids who have moved away from their hometowns to figure out what to do with their lives. Lipsky was given unprecedented access at West Point and spent a full four years following a class from wide-eyed arrival through graduation. The most fascinating cadets are the ones who don't fit the gung-ho West Point stereotype. George Rash faces expulsion on a regular basis but persistently hangs in, "Huck" Finn just wants to play football but becomes more enamored of the military life than he ever expected, and Christi Cicerelle stays perfectly coiffed and, as she says, "girly," even while becoming a highly skilled soldier. Lipsky's tenure came at a pivotal time in the institution's history: hazing had recently been discontinued (part of a series of reforms referred to with both gravity and a little remorse as "The Changes") and the attacks of September 11, 2001 placed the United States in a war which the cadets would have to fight. The academy, in Lipsky's portrayal, demands much of its charges, its standards are high, and the possibility of being "separated" from West Point looms large for any cadet not up to par. Yet the cadets are shown as largely happy people, using the harsh demands of a West Point experience to find the kind of structure and purpose that other college students would envy. Lipsky, a contributing editor at <i>Rolling Stone</i>, creates portraits that are, by turns, hilarious, touching, harrowing, disappointing and joyful. As his subjects finally graduate and launch their careers, readers may feel like a proud parent or friend standing in the crowd and cheering their accomplishments. <i>--John Moe</i>"Absolutely amazing. Lipsky doesn't just get close to his characters. He's inside their skin. With a laser eye for every telling detail, and with glistening prose, he delivers an uncannily intimate chronicle of West Point life. This is the rare work of non-fiction that actually does read like a gripping novel." <br> -- John Colapinto, author of As Nature Made Him and About the Author <p>"A remarkable achievement. This superbly written account offers an unprecedented look inside one of America&#x2019;s most mythic places. It is absolutely engrossing." <br> -- Kevin Baker, author of Dreamland and Paradise Alley </p><p>"Absolutely American has the feel of a classic, a book that will be read for years, by the military-minded of course, but also by everyone with the imagination to see their life as a test, the results of which go right into the permanent record. In addition to being one of our best writers and storytellers, David Lipsky has a great pair of eyes. He has taken the military experience and turned it into poetry, as smooth and elegant and purposeful as the sound made by a column of marching soldiers." <br> -- Rich Cohen, author of Tough Jews and Lake Effect </p><p>"A deeply insightful, brilliantly revealing book about the highs and lows of being a West Point cadet. In the tradition of Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, and George Plimpton, David Lipsky embedded himself at the U.S. Military Academy, hoping to deflate its time-honored myths. He succeeded. Absolutely American is an unqualified page turner." <br> -- Douglas Brinkley, Director of the Eisenhower Center, author of Wheels for the World and The American Heritage History of the United States</p></p><h2>Paths of the Messiah: And Sites of the Early Church from Galilee to Jerusalem</h2><p><p>Nazareth, the Sea of Galilee, Jerusalem: The places where Jesus lived and died and gathered his followers into a community are for Christians the most holy sites on earth. With reverence for the sites associated with the life of Christ, Bargil Pixner dedicated much of his life to archeological research in the Holy Land, becoming famous for his discovery of the Essene Gate in Jerusalem and the town of Bethsaida by the Sea of Galilee.</p><p>Gathered into this one volume are the principal fruits of Father Pixner&#x2019;s research: explanations of numerous archeological discoveries in the Holy Land accompanied by photos, illustrations and maps. Prepared in collaboration with Professor Rainer Riesner, a Scripture scholar from the University of Dortmund, the chapters bring to light not only those details of interest to the man of science but also the connections between these and early Christianity of interest to the man of faith.</p><p>Having lived in Israel for much of his life the Tyrolean priest, scholar, teacher, and pilgrimage leader brought to his subject the depth and familiarity of a native son. Father Pixner&#x2019;s particular interest in the first Jewish Christians runs like a thread through many of these chapters, helping to link the practices of modern believers with those of their ancient brothers and sisters in the faith.</p></p><p><b>Fr. Bargil Pixner, O.S.B.</b>, was born into a German-speaking family in northern Italy in 1921. After becoming a missionary priest in 1946, he served lepers in the Philippines for eight years. After several years of giving spiritual direction to priests in the United States and Europe, Father Pixner moved to Israel, where he studied Hebrew and biblical archeology and geography. In 1973 he joined the Benedictines at Dormition Abbey on Mount Zion, where he pursued Jewish-Christian studies. These he continued near the Sea of Galilee at the Benedictine Monastery of Tabgha, which he helped to found.</p><h2>Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O&#39;Keeffe</h2><p>A portrait of the twentieth-century woman artist discusses such topics as her marriage to art photography pioneer Alfred Stieglitz, the impact of his infidelity on her psyche, and her relocation to New Mexico, where she created her signature works. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Hunter Drohojowska-Philp was chair of liberal arts and sciences at Otis College of Art and Design.From a publisher's perspective, some biographical subjects seem to approach the inexhaustible. As I write this review, I can see on my shelves several books each about Fitzgerald, Hemingway, JFK, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Frida Kahlo, most published within a decade of one another. Is Georgia O'Keeffe destined to join this company? Is she already there? For a woman who wanted her admirers to focus on her art, not her life, her personal story is simply too striking (and too pertinent to modern gender politics) to be ignored.<p> Laurie Lisle led the way with her appreciative portrait of the artist in 1980; Roxana Robinson took another step forward with her more critical full-length biography in 1989; and, in 1991, Benita Eisler brought O'Keeffe's relationship with photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz to a mythologizing height in O'Keeffe and Stieglitz: An American Romance. In between and after these capable writers, dozens of monographs, biographical studies and catalogue essays have explored every aspect of O'Keeffe's life, including her formative experiences in Texas, her relation to New York modernism, her ties to Stieglitz and the other men in their circle, her feminism, her anti-feminism, her New Mexico years. It could be argued, though, that all this disparate material needed to be synthesized to provide a vivid account based on newly available papers and interviews with contemporaries who had been less than forthcoming when she was alive. Lengthy, balanced and serious as it is, I am not sure Hunter Drohojowska-Philp's book is quite that.</p><p> The outlines of the story are well-known. Born in Wisconsin in 1887 to an aloof mother and a likable but emotionally unsupportive father, Georgia O'Keeffe was raised in the heartland and in Virginia. Her childhood seems to have been neither brutally deprived nor overly loving. ("I was not a favorite child," she once commented.) Moving to New York to study art when she was 20 was a pivotal decision. Between the new work she absorbed in Manhattan's more advanced galleries and her fascination with the landscape of the Southwest, acquired when she worked as a teacher in Texas from 1916 to 1918, she was as psychologically and professionally prepared to let go of the past and enter an uncharted future as any artist of her generation. </p><p> For many of us, the early watercolors and forays into color abstraction are among her most striking, original creations. Later, her precisionist city scenes, floral paintings and New Mexico landscapes achieved a tenuous but intriguing balance between representational and modernist principles, and many have become iconic images in American art. Until her death at 99, O'Keeffe remained the kind of painter she always wanted to be -- unaffiliated with any particular movement, a rare combination of severe and lyrical -- and the kind of artist mid-century America craved, a female celebrity with a tough-minded attitude about her power and persona.</p><p> Those ends were not achieved with ease. Her evolution, as Full Bloom makes clear, was a matter of fits and starts, of uncertain yearnings and a healthy crankiness about being told who and what she must be. Not surprisingly, then, some of the most engrossing parts of this book are early chapters that give us Georgia O'Keeffe before she became "Georgia O'Keeffe." Too many biographies of major artists imply an implausible greatness and unvarying progress from earliest adulthood, but that isn't a trap Drohojowska-Philp falls into. </p><p> O'Keeffe was also blessed with abundant good luck, especially in her relationships with male mentors. She studied under Arthur Wesley Dow, who urged his students to move beyond the narrow ideas about art and academic realism that dominated American life before World War I. She became involved with the avant-garde photographer Paul Strand, whose work influenced her thinking about abstraction, and -- most importantly -- with Stieglitz, who, as the most important art dealer of the day, launched her career and made possible her fame and spectacular sales. Her last, infirm years in rural New Mexico would have been much more trying had it not been for the attentions of Juan Hamilton, a companion 60 years her junior. Fiercely independent she might have been, but without these men, O'Keeffe's life would have taken a very different course.</p><p> Yet her relationships with men, especially the much-older Stieglitz, whom she married, were tumultuous. Drohojowska-Philp provides a full, absorbing account of a union marked both by affection and manipulation. Neither Stieglitz nor O'Keeffe, emotionally needy and art-obsessed, would have had much use for a conventional spouse, but neither were they able to sustain their own, less traditional commitment. For O'Keeffe their bond turned out to be a kind of Faustian bargain. She began her life with the already-married Stieglitz as "the other woman" and, once she was established as a cultural force in her own right, was in turn relegated by him to the humiliating position of betrayed wife -- within a few years of their wedding. </p><p> The author's access to the late Dorothy Norman, the married woman 40 years his junior whom Stieglitz became involved with in the 1920s until his death in 1946, was crucial in her examination of this aspect of O'Keeffe's life. For decades the wealthy and controlling Norman honed her own public image in Manhattan circles as an acolyte to a great seer, but the true picture is a little less genteel. In her need to worship at the feet of a great male ego, she seems to have been a woman of her time and class, directionless and breathlessly romantic. In her speculations to Drohojowska-Philp about O'Keeffe as a lesbian, she also comes across as robustly catty. No wonder O'Keeffe came to scorn the New York art world.</p><p> Of course, O'Keeffe was not a likable person either, to put it mildly. Her rudeness and self-absorption knew no bounds. This fact shouldn't influence how we evaluate her art (my own view is that she is a fine but limited and far from great painter) and should be equally irrelevant to her worth as a biographical subject. One problem, though, is that she wasn't always unlikable in particularly interesting ways. Chronicling every snub, every arrogant gesture, every vindictive remark is a risky approach for any biographer, and we get an enormous amount of that flattening, numbing information in Full Bloom.</p><p> Sometimes O'Keeffe's famously difficult temperament had less to do with ego and more to do with respect for her art and those who came to see it. Drohojowska-Philp describes the artist's 1966 trip to the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth to attend an exhibition of her work. Dismayed by the potted pine trees in the galleries and the glare on the glass that covered one of her best paintings, she took matters into her own hands when the curators proved unhelpful, talked her way past the guards before the museum opened the next morning, and got rid of the pines and the glass. I wouldn't describe these acts as "willful demonstrations" so much as a gutsy statement of passion and sound priorities. </p><p> The more serious problem with Full Bloom, however, is its polite "Just the facts, ma'am" quality. Drohojowska-Philp's skills as a researcher and an organizer of her extensive material are never in question. There is an admirable crispness to her prose, and she offers sound commentaries on pictures, events and relationships. Yet memorable portraiture, narrative momentum and a distinctive authorial voice -- crucial skills needed to raise a biography to the level of craft we expect from a novel or an essay -- are just not her strong points. The people we meet in this book are a remarkable and eccentric lot by anybody's standards, but she often renders them through accumulations of facts and plausible quotations. She dutifully notes pain, expectation and delight but never truly evokes them.</p><p> The book ends with a terseness O'Keeffe might have appreciated (or demanded, if she had any say in the matter), but it isn't appropriate to an immersion in a life we are meant to take as extraordinary, whose end should move us. The ashes are scattered, the estate is settled, the foundation is off and running, but where is the sense that the world is a lesser place without this woman in it? Death on the page should leave an ache. The reader's need for that kind of feeling isn't about cheap emotion or pandering to a tired myth. It's simply about gratitude for a life of struggle, originality and significant accomplishment.</p><p>Reviewed by John Loughery <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Nearly two thousand years later, the richness and complexity of German history have faded beneath the long shadow of the country's darkest hour in World War II. Now award-winning historian Steven Ozment, whom the New Yorker has hailed as "a splendidly readable scholar," gives us the fullest portrait possible in this sweeping, original, and provocative history of the German people, from antiquity to the present, holding a mirror up to an entire civilization -- one that has been alternately Western Europe's most successful and most perilous.</p><p><em>A Mighty Fortress</em> boldly examines Germany's tumultuous twentieth century in light of its earliest achievements as a prosperous, civil, and moral society, tracing a line of continuity that began in ancient times and has endured through the ages, despite its enemies and itself. Ozment's story takes us from the tribes of the Roman Empire and the medieval dynasties to the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification. He shows that the Germans are a people who desire national unity yet have kept themselves from it by aligning with autocratic territorial governments and regional cultures. From Luther, Kant, Goethe, and Beethoven to Marx, Einstein, Bismarck, and Hitler, the country's leading figures have always tried to become everything and more than what ordinary mortals could be. In fact, Germans living centuries apart have shared in different ways a common defining experience that is unique to their culture: a convergence of external provocation and wounded pride, and an unusual ability to exercise great power in response to both.</p><p>In this work of penetrating, virtuoso scholarship, Steven Ozment captures the soul of a nation that is at once ordered and chaotic, disciplined and obsessive, proud and uncertain. Epic in scope, refreshing in its insights, and written with nuance, acumen, and verve, A Mighty Fortress presents the history of the Germans as the story of humanity writ large.</p></p><p><p>Steven Ozment is McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History at Harvard University and the author of <em>The B�rgermeister's Daughter; Flesh and Spirit; Ancestors; Protestants; </em>and <em>The Age of Reform,</em> a finalist for the National Book Award and winner of the Schaff History Prize. He lives in Newburyport, Massachusetts.</p><p> Early on in this history of roughly 2,000 years of certain people living in central Europe, Steven Ozment describes his enormous task as the "Tacitus Challenge." Tacitus wrote his account of what he called the "various peoples of Germany" in 98 A.D., at a time when popular interest in the tribes was high among Romans. He recognized an opportunity both to instruct his fellow citizens in Germanic virtues and to warn them of potential Germanic dangers. Still, the northern tribes had done little so far to disrupt Roman affairs, and it took no more than 46 paragraphs to sketch their customs, character and geography.</p><p>But times have changed, and now a restrained 300-plus pages of text hardly suffice to meet the Tacitus challenge of providing an overview that mixes the "praise and criticism a complex people deserves." Still, Ozment works mightily to show that disparate developments in an ill-defined geographical area can indeed yield up a coherent tale of one people, the Germans. He begins with -- what else? -- the tribes encountered by the Romans, that whole intertwining complex of ancient Gothia that inspired Tolkien. Having disoriented the reader with Gotho-Roman encounters among leaders named Alaric, Athaulf and Attalus, he moves briskly through a succession of marginally more familiar characters who established the Merovingian, Carolingian and Hohenstaufen dynasties and are sometimes called Goths or Franks but increasingly, as the pages turn, simply Germans. By page 49, a sixth of the way through the text, with Tacitus's Germania hardly a memory and Charlemagne's mighty empire divided, as Caesar once partitioned Gaul, into three sections, we encounter "the foundation stones of a fragmented and competitive medieval German realm," in other words, Germany. </p><p>From here on out, it becomes a matter of following these Germans as they undergo fragmentation and consolidation, fall prey to predatory rulers and neighbors, divide by region, religion, class and gender, start wars and suffer wars and throughout it all, seemingly, write a great deal of philosophy and make a great deal of music. A book as extensive in chronological scope as this one amounts to an exercise in advanced pruning, of cutting off everything extraneous while retaining precisely what will make the whole lively and intelligible. Unfortunately, Ozment, who is a professor of ancient and medieval history at Harvard, is better at elaborating than pruning. His best work has been of the micro-historical variety, in which a lovingly recreated small world tells us about the larger world in which it existed. This big picture of Germany both leaves out too much, especially of the connective tissue that carries a story forward, and lingers too long on individuals, some famous (Bach and Nietzsche, for instance) and others clearly chosen because they are not famous (an odd sort of anthropologist character named Bogumil Goltz, who gets more pages than Friedrich Schiller; and an unnamed emigr� pastor in Boston, who is quoted at almost as great a length as Luther). </p><p>Of course, illustrative individuals can play a role in even so synoptic a history as this, but it should not be at the cost of exploring their context more adequately. Added to that, many of the summaries of key moments in German development are borderline incoherent, a problem that becomes acute in the hasty account of the wars of the 20th century and Hitler's rise to power. It is perfectly defensible, even admirable, to offer a history of Germany not obsessively concerned with accounting for the origins of its 20th-century catastrophe, but a reader not already conversant with German history will find the frequent folding-back of the narrative line difficult to follow and the details of the story unreliable (for instance, the French "Maginot fortifications," not built until the 1930s, here block the German advance in 1914). </p><p>The book is strongest in describing the characteristic features of early modern Germany, as it developed the institutions of modern social and cultural life and suffered through torments of individual conscience and devastating war. It is weakest in showing just exactly how such experiences were formative. Ozment makes a number of references to the German dualist tradition, to German inwardness, to German "fear of anarchistic and hyphenated Germans," and to a German national movement and search for national identity, but he commits himself to none of these or other possible threads of continuity. In his effort to avoid the Luther-to-Hitler trap of writing history with foreboding music always playing in the background, he relies ultimately on banalities that could be true of many national groups. The Germans have been concerned since the 16th century, he says near the end, with "the ability to act collectively -- national unity -- and the right to act individually -- political representation." How true, but how true also of Frenchmen and Englishmen and Italians and, if we change 16th to 18th century, of North Americans as well. "Making the most of their surroundings became the German way of survival and self-discovery" -- could not the same be said of Huck Finn? This book is eminently charitable to the German people, and, in the end, minus the poets and philosophers, they look just like us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Celia Applegate</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

She has published many books including The Naked Nude, A World of Our Own: Women as Artists, and At Home: The Domestic Interior in Art. She lives in England.Women artists have been painting self-portraits since the 12th century but, notes Borzello, a specialist in the social history of art, the genre has received surprisingly little attention. Her thorough, lucid study goes a long way toward providing a remedy for that oversight. Women artists have painted themselves for the same reasons as male artists--to call attention to their skills, to emulate the self-portraits of past masters, to express elements not appropriate to other kinds of subject matter, such as wit or a sharp sense of social criticism, and to boldly announce particular beliefs about art. But they have also done so for some unique reasons: to claim a place among serious artists, to explore the often peculiar status of women in Western societies, and to examine the issue of feminine beauty. Borzello traces women's self-portraits across eight centuries, deftly weaving together art and social history, the biographies of many women artists, and a wide selection of paintings, prints, and photographs by women. While some of the pieces are primarily of historical interest, there are some stunning works here, including period works by such accomplished painters as Artemisia Gentileschi and Rosalba Carriera and modern works by such little known but talented painters as Zinaida Serebryakova and Lotte Laserstein, and paintings by such familiar figures as Frida Kahol and Paula Modersohn-Racker. A fascinating monograph, and a particularly useful contribution to both women's studies and art history. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It was supposed to be safe.<br>An isolated writers' colony, where we could work,<br>run by an old, old, dying man named Whittier,<br>until it wasn't.<br>And we were supposed to write poetry. Pretty poetry.<br>This crowd of us, his gifted students,<br>locked away from the ordinary world for three months.<br>And we called each other the "Matchmaker." And the "Missing Link."<br>Or "Mother Nature." Silly labels. Free-association names.<br>The same way--when you were little--you invented names for the plants and<br>animals in your world. You called peonies--sticky with nectar and crawling with<br>ants--the "ant flower." You called collies: Lassie Dogs.<br>But even now, the same way you still call someone "that man with one leg."<br>Or, "you know, the black girl . . ."<br>We called each other:<br>The "Earl of Slander."<br>Or "Sister Vigilante."<br>The names we earned, based on our stories. The names we gave each other,<br>based on our life instead of our family:<br>"Lady Baglady."<br>"Agent Tattletale."<br>Names based on our sins instead of our jobs:<br>"Saint Gut-Free."<br>And the "Duke of Vandals."<br>Based on our faults and crimes. The opposite of superhero names.<br>Silly names for real people. As if you cut open a rag doll and found inside:<br>Real intestines, real lungs, a beating heart, blood. A lot of hot, sticky blood.<br>And we were supposed to write short stories. Funny short stories.<br>Too many of us, locked away from the world for one whole<br>spring, summer, winter, autumn--one whole season of that year.<br>It doesn't matter who we were as people, not to old Mr. Whittier.<br>But he didn't say this at first.<br>To Mr. Whittier, we were lab animals. An experiment.<br>But we didn't know.<br>No, this was only a writers' retreat until it was too late for us to be anything,<br>except his victims.<br><br>1.<br><br>When the bus pulls to the corner where Comrade Snarky had agreed to wait, she stands there in an army-surplus flak jacket--dark olive-green--and baggy camouflage pants, the cuffs rolled up to show infantry boots. A suitcase on either side of her. With a black beret pulled down tight on her head, she could be anyone.<br><br>"The rule was . . . ," Saint Gut-Free says into the microphone that hangs above his steering wheel.<br><br>And Comrade Snarky says, "Fine." She leans down to unbuckle a luggage tag off one suitcase. Comrade Snarky tucks the luggage tag in her olive-green pocket, then lifts the second suitcase and steps up into the bus. With one suitcase still on the curb, abandoned, orphaned, alone, Comrade Snarky sits down and says, "Okay."<br><br>She says, "Drive."<br><br>We were all leaving notes, that morning. Before dawn. Sneaking out on tiptoe with our suitcase down dark stairs, then along dark streets with only garbage trucks for company. We never did see the sun come up.<br><br>Sitting next to Comrade Snarky, the Earl of Slander was writing something in a pocket notepad, his eyes flicking between her and his pen.<br><br>And, leaning over sideways to look, Comrade Snarky says, "My eyes are <i>green</i>, not <i>brown</i>, and my hair is naturally this color <i>auburn</i>." She watches as he writes <i>green</i>, then says, "And I have a little red rose tattooed on my butt cheek." Her eyes settle on the silver tape recorder peeking out of his shirt pocket, the little-mesh microphone of it, and she says, "Don't write <i>dyed hair</i>. Women either <i>lift</i> or <i>tint</i> the color of their hair."<br><br>Near them sits Mr. Whittier, where his spotted, trembling hands can grip the folded chrome frame of his wheelchair. Beside him sits Mrs. Clark, her breasts so big they almost rest in her lap.<br><br>Eyeing them, Comrade Snarky leans into the gray flannel sleeve of the Earl of Slander. She says, "Purely ornamental, I assume. And of no nutritive value . . ."<br><br>That was the day we missed our last sunrise.<br><br>At the next dark street corner, where Sister Vigilante stands waiting, she holds up her thick black wristwatch, saying, "We agreed on four-thirty-five." She taps the watch face with her other hand, saying, "It is now four-thirty-nine . . ."<br><br>Sister Vigilante, she brought a fake-leather case with a strap handle, a flap that closed with a snap to protect the Bible inside. A purse handmade to lug around the Word of God.<br><br>All over the city, we waited for the bus. At street corners or bus-stop benches, until Saint Gut-Free drove up. Mr. Whittier sitting near the front with Mrs. Clark. The Earl of Slander. Comrade Snarky and Sister Vigilante.<br><br>Saint Gut-Free pulls the lever to fold open the door, and standing on the curb is little Miss Sneezy. The sleeves of her sweater lumpy with dirty tissues stuffed inside. She lifts her suitcase and it rattles loud as popcorn in a microwave oven. With every step up the stairs into the bus, the suitcase rattles loud as far-off machine-gun fire, and Miss Sneezy looks at us and says, "My pills." She gives the suitcase a loud shake and says, "A whole three months' supply . . ."<br><br>That's why the rule about only so much luggage. So we would all fit.<br><br>The only rule was one bag per person, but Mr. Whittier didn't say how big or what kind.<br><br>When Lady Baglady climbed on board, she wore a diamond ring the size of a popcorn kernel, her hand holding a leash, the leash dragging a leather suitcase on little wheels.<br><br>Waving her fingers to make her ring sparkle, Lady Baglady says, "It's my late husband, cremated and made into a three-carat diamond . . ."<br><br>At that, Comrade Snarky leans over the notepad where the Earl of Slander is writing, and she says, "<i>Facelift</i> is one word."<br><br>A few blocks later, after a couple traffic lights and around some corners waits Chef Assassin, carrying a molded aluminum suitcase with, inside, all his white elastic underpants and T-shirts and socks folded down to squares tight as origami. Plus a matched set of chef's knives. Under that, his aluminum suitcase is solid-packed with banded stacks of money, all of it hundred-dollar bills. All of it so heavy he used both hands to lift it into the bus.<br><br>Down another street, under a bridge and around the far side of a park, the bus pulled to the curb where no one seemed to wait. There the man we called the "Missing Link" stepped out of the bushes near the curb. Balled in his arms, he carried a black garbage bag, torn and leaking plaid flannel shirts.<br><br>Looking at the Missing Link, but talking sideways to the Earl of Slander, Comrade Snarky said, "His<i> beard</i> looks like something Hemingway might've shot . . ."<br><br>The dreaming world, they'd think we were crazy. Those people still in bed, they'd be asleep another hour, then washing their faces, under their arms, and between their legs, before going to the same work they did every day. Living that same life, every day.<br><br>Those people would cry to find us gone, but they would cry, too, if we were boarding a ship to start a new life across some ocean. Emigrating. Pioneers.<br><br>This morning, we were astronauts. Explorers. Awake while they slept.<br><br>These people would cry, but then they would go back to waiting tables, painting houses, programming computers.<br><br>At our next stop, Saint Gut-Free swung open the doors, and a cat ran up the steps and down the aisle between the seats of the bus. Behind the cat came Director Denial, saying, "His name is Cora." The cat's name was Cora Reynolds. "I didn't name him," said Director Denial, the tweed blazer and skirt she wore frosted with cat hair. One lapel swollen out from her chest.<br><br>"A shoulder holster," says Comrade Snarky, leaning close to tell the tape recorder in the Earl of Slander's shirt pocket.<br>All of this--whispering in the dark, leaving notes, keeping secret--it was our adventure.<br><br>If you were planning to be stranded on a desert island for three months, what would you bring along?<br><br>Let's say all your food and water would be provided, or so you think.<br><br>Let's say you can only bring along one suitcase because there will be a lot of you, and the bus taking you all to the desert island is only so big.<br><br>What would you pack in your suitcase?<br><br>Saint Gut-Free brought boxes of pork-rind snacks and dried cheese puffs, his fingers and chin orange with the salt dust. One bony hand gripping the steering wheel, he tilted each box to pour the snacks into his thin face.<br><br>Sister Vigilante brought a shopping bag of clothes with a satchel bag set in the top.<br><br>Leaning over her own huge breasts, holding them like a child in her arms, Mrs. Clark asked, did Sister Vigilante bring along a human head?<br><br>And Sister Vigilante opened the satchel far enough to show the three holes of a black bowling ball, saying, "My hobby . . ."<br><br>Comrade Snarky looks from the Earl of Slander scribbling into his notepad, then looks at Sister Vigilante's braided-tight black hair, not one strand pulling loose from its pins.<br><br>"<i>That</i>," Comrade Snarky says, "<i>is tinted hair</i>."<br><br>At our next stop, Agent Tattletale stood with a video camera held to one eye, filming the bus as it pulled to the curb. He brought a stack of business cards he passed out to prove he was a private detective. With his video camera held as a mask covering half his face, he filmed us, walking down the aisle to an empty seat at the back, blinding everyone with his spotlight.<br><br>A city block later, the Matchmaker climbed on board, tracking horse shit on his cowboy boots. A straw cowboy hat in his hands and a duffel bag hung over one shoulder, he sat and peeled back his window and spit brown tobacco juice down the brushed-steel side of the bus.<br><br>This is what we brought along for three months outside of the world. Agent Tattletale, his video camera. Sister Vigilante, her bowling ball. Lady Baglady, her diamond ring. This is what we'd need to write our stories. Miss Sneezy, her pills and tissues. Saint Gut-Free, his snack food. The Earl of Slander, his notebook and tape recorder.<br>Chef Assassin, his knives.<br><br>In the dim light of the bus, we all spied on Mr. Whittier, the workshop organizer. Our teacher. You could see the spotted shiny dome of his scalp under the few gray hairs combed across. The button-down collar of his shirt stood up, a starched white fence around his thin, spotted neck.<br><br>"The people you're sneaking away from," Mr. Whittier would say, "they don't want you enlightened. They want to know what to expect."<br><br>Mr. Whittier would tell you, "You cannot be the person they know and the great, glorious person you want to become. Not at the same time."<br><br>The people who really, actually loved us, Mr. Whittier said they'd beg us to go. To fulfill our dream. Practice our craft. And they would love us when we all came back.<br><br>In three months.<br><br>The little bit of life we'd each gamble.<br><br>We'd risk.<br><br>This much time, we'd bet on our own ability to create some masterpiece. A short story or poem or screenplay or memoir that would make sense of our life. A masterpiece that would buy our way out of slavery to a husband or a parent or a corporation. That would earn our freedom.<br><br>All of us, driving along the empty streets in the dark. Miss Sneezy fishes a damp tissue out of her sweater sleeve and blows her nose. She sniffs and says, "Sneaking out this way, I was so afraid of getting caught." Tucking the tissue back inside her cuff, she says, "I feel just like . . . Anne Frank."<br><br>Comrade Snarky digs the luggage tag out of her jacket pocket, the remains of her abandoned suitcase. Her abandoned life. And, turning the tag over and over in her hand, still looking at it, Comrade Snarky says, "The way I see it . . ." She says, "Anne Frank had life pretty good."<br><br>And Saint Gut-Free, his mouth full of corn chips, watching us all in the rearview mirror, chewing salt and fat, he says, "How's that?"<br><br>Director Denial pets her cat. Mrs. Clark pets her breasts. Mr. Whittier, his chrome wheelchair.<br><br>Under a streetlight, on a corner up ahead, the dark outline of another would-be writer waits.<br><br>"At least Anne Frank," Comrade Snarky said, "never had to tour with her book . . ."<br><br>And Saint Gut-Free hits the air brakes and cranks the steering wheel to pull over.<br>Landmarks<br><br><i>A Poem About Saint Gut-Free</i><br><br>"Here's the job I left to come here," the Saint says. "And the life I gave up."<br>He used to drive a tour bus.<br>Saint Gut-Free onstage, his arms folded across his chest--<br>so skinny<br>his hands can touch in the middle of his back<br>There stands Saint Gut-Free, with a single coat of skin <br>painted on his skeleton.<br>His collarbones loop out from his chest, big as grab <br>handles.<br>His ribs show through his white T-shirt, and his belt--<br>instead of his butt--keeps up his blue jeans.<br>Onstage, instead of a spotlight, a movie fragment:<br>the colors of houses and sidewalks, street signs and <br>parked cars,<br>wipe sideways across his face. A mask of heavy traffic. <br>Vans and trucks.<br>He says, "That job, driving tour bus . . ."<br>It was all Japanese, Germans, Koreans, all with English as <br>a second language, with phrase<br>books clutched in one hand, nodding and smiling at <br>whatever he told the<br>microphone as he steered the bus around corners, down <br>streets, past the houses of<br>movie stars or extra-bloody murders, apartments where <br>rock stars had overdosed.<br>Every day the same tour, the same mantra of murder, <br>movie stars, accidents. Places<br>where peace treaties got signed.

Up there, the shrine of Saint Wendy.<br>"The Patron Saint of Therapeutic Abortion."<br>Parked in front of his own apartment,<br>he tells the bus, "There's the shrine of Saint Gut-Free,"<br>the Saint himself, his pigeon shoulders, rubber-band lips, <br>and baggy shirt,<br>reflected even smaller in the rearview mirror.<br>"The Patron Saint of Masturbation."<br>While each seat in his bus, nodding heads, craning their <br>necks, they look to see<br>something divine.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Plants of the Bible: A Gardener&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Lilies of the field . . . thorns by the wayside . . . plants that grew in the lands of the Bible?

Now with husband Kenneth beside her to share her joy and oversee the family&#39;s legacy, Kyle&#39;s life seems perfect. And then a medical diagnosis pulls the thread that leaves the tapestry of her world unraveling around her. Utterly isolated from the emotional and spiritual anchors in her life, Kyle discovers that her &#34;homecoming&#34; was only the beginning of the story.</p><p>Janette Oke (pronounced "oak") pioneered inspirational fiction and is the leading author in the category today. Love Comes Softly, her first novel, has sold over one million copies. Janette is now the bestselling author of over 70 books, 32 of which have been translated into fourteen languages. Her books have sold over 22 million copies.<br>Janette receives fan mail from all over the world and answers each letter personally. She received the 1992 President's Award from the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association for her significant contribution to Christian fiction, the 1999 CBA Life Impact Award and has been awarded the Gold Medallion Award for fiction.<br>Janette and her husband, Edward, have four grown children and enjoy their many grandchildren. They make their home in Canada.The sequel to last summer's <i>Another Homecoming</i> is a straightforward lesson in faith, rather than another convoluted tale, more typical of Bunn than Oke, about confused blood-lines and the presumed dead coming to life. It's almost as though Bunn wrote the first novel, and Oke this one, though both productions are blander by far than either writer's individual work. Kyle Adams returns: she's now married to a solid man of faith and is gloriously happy in her gingerbread row house in Georgetown. Kyle's wicked stepmother is back, less wicked now than grumpy; her real parents are back, humble and cornball as ever; and her noble brother, minister to the homeless, is back, too, about to be married despite a congenital heart condition. Speaking of hearts, Kyle has her baby right after her brother's wedding, and her son has a weak heart and may not live. This puts a strain on Kyle and Kenneth's young marriage: they question their faith as individuals and as a couple and wonder why God can sometimes seem remote. Wouldn't it be extraordinary if Kyle's baby were to die, and if, after turmoil and painful introspection, she reached real insights about faith? That might happen if C. S. Lewis were marooned in such a plot, but not with this team: the baby's fine, the marriage is fine, God is fine. Kyle's observation that "the day was just too wonderful, the miracles too abundant" pretty much sums things up. <i>John Mort</i></p><h2>Azrael: Death&#39;s Dark Knight</h2><p>In the wake of BATMAN R.I.P and BATTLE FOR THE COWL, writer Fabian Nicieza (SUPERMAN, TRINITY) and artist Ramon Bachs (RED ROBIN) introduce an all-new Avenging Angel.

Will his quest bring him closer to his goal of redemption or simply drive him insane?

Do you have to be born musical to become musical? Do you have to start at the age of six? <br><br>Using the tools of his day job as a cognitive psychologist, Gary Marcus becomes his own guinea pig as he takes up the guitar. In a powerful and incisive look at how both children and adults become musical, Guitar Zero traces Marcus&#x2019;s journey, what he learned, and how anyone else can learn, too. A groundbreaking peek into the origins of music in the human brain, this musical journey is also an empowering tale of the mind&#x2019;s enduring plasticity. <br><br>Marcus investigates the most effective ways to train body and brain to learn to play an instrument, in a quest that takes him from Suzuki classes to guitar gods. From deliberate and efficient practicing techniques to finding the right music teacher, Marcus translates his own experience&#x2014;as well as reflections from world-renowned musicians&#x2014;into practical advice for anyone hoping to become musical, or to learn a new skill.<br><br>Guitar Zero debunks the popular theory of an innate musical instinct while simultaneously challenging the idea that talent is only a myth. While standing the science of music on its head, Marcus brings new insight into humankind&#x2019;s most basic question: what counts as a life well lived? Does one have to become the next Jimi Hendrix to make a passionate pursuit worthwhile, or can the journey itself bring the brain lasting satisfaction?<br><br>For all those who have ever set out to play an instrument&#x2014;or wish that they could&#x2014;Guitar Zero is an inspiring and fascinating look at the pursuit of music, the mechanics of the mind, and the surprising rewards that come from following one&#x2019;s dreams.<br><p></p></p><p><b>Gary Marcus</b> studies evolution, language, and cognitive development at New York University, where he is a professor of psychology and the director of the NYU Center for Child Language.

Just a real jerk.&#x201d;</p><p>My career arc would continue through places like &#x201c;Apple Country,&#x201d; a convenience store that did not sell apples, and &#x201c;Maurice the Pants Man,&#x201d; no Maurice but plenty of pants.</p><p>I&#x2019;d spend sixteen years traveling through corporate America, writing advertising for the Home Depot, branding for Bose and marketing for Staples. I was laid off from one start-up, fired from another, ran my own into the ground and then found and left my dream job. Along the way, I learned one lesson about work.</p><p>You control more than you think.</p><p>Good job, bad job, dream job, no job, this is true.</p><p>It&#x2019;s on us. Though we often prefer to blame others or the economy or a boss who doesn&#x2019;t &#x201c;get us,&#x201d; the reality is that a better job begins with building a better you.</p><p>Work is not the enemy.</p><p>Work does not have to be a miserable bar-free prison we voluntarily serve time in until the parole of retirement. On the contrary, work can be great.</p><p>Work can be wonderful.</p><p>If we rescue Monday. If we dare to reinvent it. If we refuse to get stuck.</p><p>This book isn&#x2019;t about quitting a job. (I already wrote that one, it&#x2019;s called <i>Quitter</i> because I&#x2019;m creative like that.)</p><p>This book isn&#x2019;t about starting something. (I already wrote that one too; it&#x2019;s called <i>Start</i>.)</p><p>This book is about intentionally building a career using the four investments every extraordinary career has in common.</p><p>The investments are so obvious you just might miss them. The balloon animal guy certainly did with me that night in the field.</p><p>Lest you fear I spend the weirdest Craigslist-initiated weekends ever, let me back up a second. I assure you I can explain my moonlit rendezvous with the man in the rainbow suspenders.</p><p>I was waiting in line with my wife and kids at Family Fun Night at our local elementary school. It was Friday night and next to the face-painting lady, the balloon guy is whom you visit immediately at events like that.</p><p>While twisting and pulling at the colorful balloons, this craftsman of inflated rubber looked down at me from the stool he was standing on.</p><p>&#x201c;I love your books,&#x201d; he said, recognizing me and smiling, but then some other thought dimmed his otherwise bright eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry about today,&#x201d; he added in a more serious tone. &#x201c;I wish you the best in your future endeavors.&#x201d;</p><p>The balloon animal guy was encouraging me because he believed I lost a lot.</p><p>And he was right, I did lose something. We always do when we leave old places for new adventures.</p><p>That morning, I left my dream job.</p><p>In the process, I left behind products, money and the craziest opportunities I&#x2019;d ever had.</p><p>If you tallied the day, it might be my most loserish day of all time. Even reading about what I left behind made me feel a little like I was going to scream Phil Collins lyrics at the balloon animal guy: &#x201c;Take a look at me now, oh there&#x2019;s just an empty space.&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t blame the guy wearing a fanny pack of balloons for worrying about the future of my career.</p><p>But I had something he didn&#x2019;t know about.</p><p>A tool kit I would have never jumped without.</p><p>A tool kit you probably already have too.</p><p>A tool kit my friend Nate was about to need.</p><p>&#x25a0; The Day Everything Changed</p><p>My neighbor Nate lost his job on a Friday.</p><p>If you are ever invited to a late Friday afternoon meeting with your boss, that&#x2019;s not a meeting, that&#x2019;s a booby trap.</p><p>Nate&#x2019;s career quickly changed that day.</p><p>He was suddenly afloat and not by his own choice.</p><p>I met with him the next week for coffee.</p><p>With a dazed expression he told me how he felt losing a job he&#x2019;d had for eight years.</p><p>He was good at it. He always hit his numbers. People liked him. Clients texted their condolences to him days after it had happened. He was and still is a great guy.</p><p>But he was in trouble.</p><p>Cocooned for eight years inside a big, safe company, he unexpectedly found himself out on the streets. The career home he had constructed didn&#x2019;t exist any longer and the rest of the world had changed dramatically since he entered the bio dome of that job.</p><p>With a great sense of exasperation he said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know how to use LinkedIn.&#x201d;</p><p>No one expects a sudden job change; that&#x2019;s why they are sudden. And if you&#x2019;ve been employed for longer than a year, you&#x2019;ve seen one happen&#x2014;either to you or to someone you know. A corporate rogue wave caught some boat completely off guard.</p><p>In between the massive waves of drastic career change, there are other, less pressing problems that also threaten our work. Things like Career Ceilings.</p><p>A Career Ceiling is the lid on top of your career ladder. It&#x2019;s the top height any particular job path is going to take you. I ran into one when I was a senior content designer at a software company.</p><p>I started working there as a contractor. Over time, I earned a real position within the company and in a few years I was given a senior content designer title. That&#x2019;s when I had effectively come to the end of my career path.</p><p>I was making the most money I would ever make in that role and there were no other writing roles available at that company. Nor would there ever be. The only way up was to become a creative director, which meant managing designers and copywriters. That&#x2019;s a great option for some people but for me it meant doing a whole lot less of what I actually liked doing: writing.</p><p>I was thirty-two and my life had already gently rolled to a place of inertia. I might get small raises over the years to come and slightly more responsibility, but for the most part that was it.</p><p>My wife would later tell me she was deeply concerned. With two young kids, a mortgage and a fairly new marriage, it was intimidating to stare down thirty years of possible career monotony. I might not be that adventurous, but being &#x201c;done&#x201d; careerwise at thirty-two was a jagged little pill to swallow.</p><p>When you hit a Career Ceiling, you used to have only a few options. You could:</p><p>1. Get a job at another company.</p><p>2. Do a job you didn&#x2019;t want to do, like being a creative director.</p><p>3. Suck it up and die inside over a period of roughly thirty years.</p><p>The first option doesn&#x2019;t fix things, it just delays them. You might get a different title and more money. That other company might have a &#x201c;senior senior writer&#x201d; position but eventually you&#x2019;ll face the same ceiling you faced at your previous job.</p><p>In the second option you just trade your ladder for a different one. This plan doesn&#x2019;t work well because you end up doing more of something you didn&#x2019;t want to do in the first place. If you didn&#x2019;t want to be a creative director, progressing up that ladder wouldn&#x2019;t feel like a promotion, it would feel like punishment. You would just be going deeper into the wrong career.</p><p>The third option is definitely the most depressing but it&#x2019;s also the most popular. That&#x2019;s why in a 2013 Gallup survey, 70 percent of Americans said they hated their jobs or felt disengaged.1 As a culture we&#x2019;ve collectively bought into the lie that work has to be miserable. Dilbert books didn&#x2019;t sell millions of copies because people are happy at work. We eat at TGI Fridays not TGI Mondays. We live for the weekends because we&#x2019;ve accepted that the weekdays are where dreams go to die. Poke your head up if you&#x2019;re reading this book at work. Seven of the ten people you can see hate being there. No one wants to stay at a job they don&#x2019;t like.</p><p>What if it didn&#x2019;t have to be that way? What if having the job we wanted to have was about being the person we needed to be first? What if it wasn&#x2019;t about trying to avoid career transitions but instead embracing them? Because they are coming, for all of us. Every one of us will experience a Career Jump, a Career Bump, Career Ceiling or Career Opportunity.</p><p><i>How do we make wise Career Jumps?</i></p><p><i>How do we navigate the Career Bumps?</i></p><p><i>How do we break through the Career Ceilings?</i></p><p><i>How do we make the most of unexpected Career Opportunities?</i></p><p>Turns out the solution to all four questions is the same: We build a Career Savings Account.</p><p>&#x25a0; Opening the Vault</p><p>Within twenty-four hours of leaving my last job one hundred different friends had reached out to me.</p><p>Within a week, I had a team helping me build a new blog.</p><p>Within a month I had new writing projects lined up.</p><p>This did not happen because I am amazing or have a thick, commanding head of hair. It happened because for five years I&#x2019;d been making deposits into the tool kit I call my Career Savings Account.&#x2122; Since I&#x2019;m bad at math, I came up with a very simple formula to explain the Career Savings Account (CSA).&#x2122;</p><p>Put more Twittery:</p><p>(Gang + Awesome + Nice) � Grind = Career Savings Account</p><p>What does each investment mean? Here&#x2019;s how we&#x2019;ll define them:</p><p><i>Relationships = Who you know. The gang you lock arms with during your career.</i></p><p><i>Skills = What you do. The tools you use to build your career.</i></p><p><i>Character = Who you are. The mortar that holds the entire CSA together.</i></p><p><i>Hustle = How you work. The fuel that pushes you to do the things other people don&#x2019;t, so you can enjoy the results other people won&#x2019;t.</i></p><p>You&#x2019;re already familiar with every part of the Career Savings Account. Regardless of your current job situation, you weren&#x2019;t surprised to hear that you need anything on that list. No one read it and thought, &#x201c;Character? I&#x2019;ve never thought to have that!&#x201d;</p><p>You&#x2019;ve also already applied aspects of the CSA to other parts of your life. You&#x2019;ve worked on the skills of your golf game to get better. You hustled when you and your wife were dating to convince her you were the one. You&#x2019;ve built relationships with sorority sisters who you still keep in touch with long after college ended.</p><p>The items aren&#x2019;t new, but the direction we focus them is. You already have most of the things you need for a Career Jump, Bump, Ceiling or Opportunity; you&#x2019;ve just likely never applied them to your job.</p><p>Or, like me in the first seven years of my career, you haven&#x2019;t combined all four investments before. Maybe you&#x2019;re amazing at relationships and skills, but haven&#x2019;t mastered the art of hustle yet. Or you&#x2019;ve got the type of character people write folk songs about but have never honed a set of skills. It&#x2019;s not that you have a bad career, but in the absence of one investment, the other three never reach their full potential.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what happens if you only have three pieces of a Career Savings Account:</p><p><i>Relationships + Skills + Character &#x2013; Hustle = Wasted Potential, NFL Draft Busts, One-Hit-Wonder Bands</i></p><p><i>Skills + Character + Hustle &#x2013; Relationships = The Career Version of the Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes</i></p><p><i>Character + Hustle + Relationships &#x2013; Skills = Me in the NBA or Michael Jordan in Baseball</i></p><p><i>Relationships + Hustle + Skills &#x2013; Character = Tiger Woods, Enron, Guns N&#x2019; Roses</i></p><p>I didn&#x2019;t really even know I had been building a CSA until I saw how I was handling my jump and how people thought I should be handling it.</p><p>People would approach me with sad looks on their face, as if I had lost a limb. With quiet, concerned voices that sounded like chamomile tea they would ask me questions like,</p><p>&#x201c;Are you guys going to move?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anything we can do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could we just hold you awkwardly and cry together for a while?&#x201d;</p><p>These were all nice questions, but they revealed an interesting belief: Someone who is in career transition should be devastated.</p><p>The reason most people think this is that they don&#x2019;t have anything to fall back on. An unexpected Career Do Over forces them to swing wide the doors of their vault and for the first time they are horrified at how empty it is. They&#x2019;ve never created a Career Savings Account and didn&#x2019;t even know they needed one until they were desperate.</p><p>Why is that the case?</p><p>Because we were taught to work jobs, not build careers.</p><p>&#x25a0; Why We Ignore Our Careers</p><p>People often say it&#x2019;s not what you know, it&#x2019;s who you know. When I have a problem with my cable, I call the Comcast guy. When I have a problem with my computer system, I call my IT guy. When I have a problem with my money, I call my financial adviser.</p><p>In almost every single situation in life that you will face, there&#x2019;s someone you can call or e-mail for help.</p><p>Except for your career.</p><p>Except for the thing you do at least forty hours each week.</p><p>Except for that thing you&#x2019;re going to do in order to pay off a $100,000 student loan.</p><p>That area has few experts or counselors. It is by and large left vulnerable and unprotected. It is not because we are bad at seeking advice. And it&#x2019;s not that we&#x2019;re bad planners. Look at the way we approach saving for college.</p><p>If you haven&#x2019;t started a college fund for your child by the time you leave the maternity ward with that wrinkled raisin of a human, you are already behind. And probably a pretty lousy parent.</p><p>The second they emerge from the womb you have a great sense of dread that college is almost here. Every parent on the planet just makes you feel worse as they tell you constantly at dinner parties, &#x201c;It goes by so fast. Kids grow up so fast! Dust in the wind.&#x201d;</p><p>You call your financial adviser and set up some sort of upside-down Roth IRA. (I&#x2019;m sketchy on the specifics but I&#x2019;m pretty sure my guy Jeff has used those words around me.) You start saving and paying off debt in preparation for college.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not all. You also have to get your kids signed up for the right activities. When I was a kid, I spent my entire elementary school career just trying to jump my bike off of angled piles of dirt in the woods. Now though, each year the need to get a kid good activities for a college application starts earlier and earlier. My daughter spent one Saturday participating in the math Olympics. She&#x2019;s on a competitive math track, one that will prepare her for the future and hopefully college.</p><p>She was also in the fourth grade at the time.</p><p>We pull the college slingshot back so far until finally high school graduation comes and we release it. We head off to four or five amazing years. Our parents needed eighteen years to prepare for those and it is all worth it.</p><p>We graduate college, eventually find a job and then wait for the next career transition we&#x2019;ll prepare for, which turns out is retirement.</p><p>From the age of twenty-two to sixty-two this is the only thing we are taught to get ready for. We have conversations about our 401(k). We start paying for our house so we have somewhere to live when our jobs are ...</p></p><h2>Man-Kzin Wars XII (12)</h2><p>First Time in Paperback. <br> <br>Kzin and Human Clash Again in this All-New Report from the Frontlines of the Top Selling Space War in Science Fiction.<br><br>The kzin, formerly invincible conquerors of all they encountered, had a hard time dealing with their ignominious defeat by the leaf-eating humans.

Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.<br></p><h2>Dream with Me: Race, Love, and the Struggle We Must Win</h2><p>According to recent surveys and studies, race relations in the United States are the worst they've been since the 1990s, and many would argue that life for most minorities has not significantly improved since the civil rights era of the 1960s. For so many, the dream of true equality has dissolved into a reality of prejudice, fear, and violence as a way of life.<br><br>John M. Perkins has been there from the beginning. Raised by his sharecropping grandparents, Perkins fled Mississippi in 1947 after his brother was fatally shot by a police officer. He led voter registration efforts in 1964, worked for school desegregation in 1967, and was imprisoned and tortured in 1970. Through it all, he has remained determined to seek justice and reconciliation based in Christ's redemptive work. <br><br>"Justice is something that every generation has to strive for," he says. And despite the setbacks of recent years, Perkins finds hope in the young people he has met all across the nation who are hard at work, bringing about reconciliation in God's name and offering acceptance to all. <i>Dream with Me</i> is his look back at a life devoted to seeking justice for all God's people, as well as a look forward to what he sees as a potentially historic breakthrough for people of every race.</p><p><b>"Justice is something every generation has to strive for."</b><br><br>A trailblazer in the civil rights movement, John M. Perkins led voter registration efforts in 1964, worked for school desegregation in 1967, and was jailed and tortured in 1970. He is no less zealous today as he sees a new generation of freedom fighters battling the same issues and the same systems he has spent his life working to correct. <br><br>Through his raw, personal stories spanning from the civil rights era to today, Perkins shows us that, though the fight is not over, there are many reasons to hope and to carry on the good work he and his contemporaries began more than a generation ago. He calls us to work for justice by living out God's redemptive love in all of our relationships.<br><br>"It all comes down to love," he says. "Love will always be our final fight."|<b>John M.

Call it what you like, it matters now more than ever. In &#34;The Ascent of Money&#34;, Niall Ferguson shows that finance is the foundation of all human progress and the lifeblood of history. From the cash injection that funded the Italian Renaissance to the stock market bubble that sparked the French Revolution, from the bonds that fueled Britain&#39;s war effort to the Wall Street Crash and today&#39;s meltdown, this is the story of boom and bust as it&#39;s never been told before. Whether you&#39;re scraping by or rolling in it, there&#39;s no better time to understand the ascent of money.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is one of Britain&#39;s most renowned historians. He is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University, a Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a Visiting Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing. He has written fourteen books, including The House of Rothschild, Empire, The War of the World, The Ascent of Money, The Great Degeneration and Kissinger, 1923-1968: The Idealist. His many prizes include the Benjamin Franklin Prize for Public Service (2010), the Hayek Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2012) and the Ludwig Erhard Prize for Economic Journalism (2013).Who knew there was a financial subtext to MARY POPPINS? Niall Ferguson--apparently--who explains that the children&#39;s classic makes the important point about banking that a bank&#39;s success is based on a fragile faith. And it&#39;s that same faith--in coins, in paper, and now in virtual banking--that lets us believe that money exists even though we don&#39;t much see it anymore. Written before the current downturn, yet seeming to predict it, the book explains that the popping sound you hear is when the &#34;belief bubble&#34; bursts (and Ferguson profiles some massive bubble makers). Narrator Simon Prebble moves along this metaphysical history of dinero with command, authority, and a BBC accent. His tone and timing add an element of class to the project. It&#39;s sort of like sitting in on a really fab Oxford lecture. R.W.S.

Delightful Dishes. A Fresh and Delicious Approach to Vegetable and Pasta Cookery.</strong><p></p><p><em>Pasta e Verdura</em>--"noodles and vegetables"--offers 140 easy and elegant recipes inspired by the healthy, delicious pasta dishes of Italy. Some quick, many low-fat, and more than a few dairy-free, these lively vegetable sauces will transform the way home cooks--and pasta eaters enjoy their favorite food.</p><p>From A to Z, Jack Bishop pairs these simple and elegant vegetable sauces--Asparagus with Mushrooms and Caramelized Shallots, Leek with White Wine and Parmesan, Stewed Eggplant with Tomatoes and Olives--with the perfect pasta for each sauce. Accompanying the recipes are tips on buying, storing, and preparing each vegetable, as well as Bishop's lively words of wisdom. He also dispels common myths (such as the need for oil in the water or the superiority of store--bought pasta) and suggests a pasta pantry for spur-of-the-moment meals. <em>Pasta e Verdura</em> is a welcome look at cooking and saucing pasta, and is just what busy cooks need to quickly create wholesome, healthy, tasty meals.</p></p><p><i>Pasta e Verdura</i> provides endless ideas for cooks who love pasta, but prefer greens to meats. Yet this is not a health-food book, nor is it a vegetarian's take on Italian cuisine. Rather, Jack Bishop made the astute observation somewhere along the line that Italians, as a consequence of tradition, and of being Italian, eat a lot of different pasta dishes that have absolutely nothing to do with high levels of meat, fat, or dairy. Healthy dishes, in other words. And impossibly delicious.<p> So, starting at the beginning of the alphabet, Bishop gives the reader Braised Artichokes with Tomatoes and Thyme served over linguine--while also explaining how to shop for the best artichokes, how to store them, and how to prep them for cooking. This format is followed for all 27 individual vegetable entries. Arugula is next, right on through to zucchini (Saut�ed Zucchini with Lemon, Pine Nuts, and Basil served over fettuccine).</p><p> Anyone who opines that eating well and living within the parameters of a sensible diet are impossible bedfellows needs this book. The results will be delicious and healthy. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>140 recipes for cooks who love pasta and want to eat healthy meals that are delicious and satisfying.</p><h2>Upbringing: A Discussion Handbook for Parents of Young Children</h2><p>James Stenson says that there&#x2019;s no magic formula that will turn you into a good parent, but that you can learn from other parents &#x2014; and avoid many pitfalls by planning ahead for parental challenges that are sure to come.

Most of the best players were white; the set shot and layup were the sport&#x2019;s chief offensive weapons. But by the 1970s, the league ruled America&#x2019;s biggest media markets; contests attracted capacity crowds and national prime-time television audiences. The game was played &#x201c;above the rim&#x201d;&#x2013;and the most marketable of its high-flying stars were black. The credit for this remarkable transformation largely goes to two giants: Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. <br><br>In <b>The Rivalry</b>, award-winning journalist John Taylor projects the stories of Russell, Chamberlain, and other stars from the NBA&#x2019;s golden age onto a backdrop of racial tensions and cultural change. Taylor&#x2019;s electrifying account of two complex men&#x2013;as well as of a game and a country at a crossroads&#x2013;is an epic narrative of sports in America during the 1960s.<br><br>It&#x2019;s hard to imagine two characters better suited to leading roles in the NBA saga: Chamberlain was cast as the athletically gifted yet mercurial titan, while Russell played the role of the stalwart centerpiece of the Boston Celtics dynasty. Taylor delves beneath these stereotypes, detailing how the two opposed and complemented each other and how they revolutionized the way the game was played and perceived by fans. <br><br>Competing with and against such heroes as Jerry West, Tom Heinsohn, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, and Elgin Baylor, and playing for the two greatest coaches of the era, Alex Hannum and the fiery Red Auerbach, Chamberlain and Russell propelled the NBA into the spotlight. But their off-court visibility and success&#x2013;to say nothing of their candor&#x2013;also inflamed passions along America&#x2019;s racial and generational fault lines. In many ways, Russell and Chamberlain helped make the NBA and, to some extent, America what they are today.<br><br>Filled with dramatic conflicts and some of the great moments in sports history, and building to a thrilling climax&#x2013;the 1969 final series, the last showdown between Russell and Chamberlain&#x2013;The Rivalry has at its core a philosophical question: Can determination and a team ethos, embodied by the ultimate team player, Bill Russell, trump sheer talent, embodied by Wilt Chamberlain? <br><br>Gripping, insightful, and utterly compelling, the story of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain is the stuff of sporting legend. Written with a reporter&#x2019;s unerring command of events and a storyteller&#x2019;s flair, <b>The Rivalry</b> will take its place as one of the classic works of sports history.</p><p>John Taylor, a journalist for more than two decades, has been a contributing editor at New York magazine and a senior writer for Esquire. He is the author of four books, including, most recently, The Count and the Confession, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, and Falling, which Entertainment Weekly ranked as one of the five best nonfiction books of 1999. He lives in East Moriches, New York, with his wife, Jeannette Walls.Chapter 1<br><br> 1<br> ON THE NIGHT of November 7, 1959, people lined up on the sidewalks outside Boston&#x2019;s North Station, a dingy yellow-brick building, and crowded along the bar at the Iron Horse, the old drinking-parlor inside. They stood in clusters on Causeway Street and Haverhill Street and Canal Street, their voices almost drowned out by the thundering traffic on the elevated highways and subway tracks that crossed above them on iron girders, and by the hiss and clang of the trains in the rail yards.<br><br> The citizens of Boston had much to debate that evening. In Washington, D.C., Charles Van Doren, the thirty-three-year-old Columbia University English professor, had just admitted to a congressional committee that the producers of Twenty-One, the television quiz show that had turned him into a national icon, had been secretly prepping him with the answers to questions. Senator John Kennedy, who had all but announced his intention to run for president the following year, had been touring California and Oregon the previous week, greeted by ecstatic crowds carrying signs saying &#x201c;Viva Kennedy!&#x201d; In Boston itself, a newspaper strike was under way, and just four days earlier, John Collins, the Suffolk County register of probate and a victim of paralytic polio who was confined to a wheelchair, had defeated Senate president John Powers for the Boston mayoralty. It was a stunning upset, brought about by an FBI raid on the headquarters of a gambling syndicate just one hundred yards from the East Boston police station and resulting in charges of widespread corruption in the city&#x2019;s government.<br><br> But the topic that consumed the crowds around North Station was neither the television scandal nor the impending administration of John Collins nor the presidential prospects of a young Irish American Catholic. It was instead basketball, specifically the game scheduled that night between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia Warriors. While Boston was a storied sports town, the sports that had always provoked the most passion were baseball and hockey, the sports of the Red Sox and the Bruins. These were sports with rich local histories, sports that had been played for generations in Boston and had, over the years, woven themselves so deeply into the fabric of the city that residence there seemed virtually synonymous with a rabid devotion to its baseball and hockey teams. Professional basketball, in contrast, was only thirteen years old in 1959. Walter Brown, the owner of the Bruins and leaseholder on the Boston Garden, had started the Celtics to fill seats at the arena on nights when his beloved hockey team was not playing and the big, drafty building, located above the train station, would otherwise sit dark and empty. In other words, the team was a purely commercial afterthought in a sport without strong roots in the city&#x2019;s culture, and for much of the fifties, attendance at its games reflected this. Rarely was the Garden more than half filled on the nights it played. Members of the Celtics joked that while Ted Williams could not get out of a car on Charles Street without being mobbed, their entire team could walk the length of the Common and no one would give them a second glance.<br><br> On the night of November 7, however, every one of the 13,909 seats in the Garden had long been sold out, even the hundreds of seats whose views became partially obstructed when the hockey arena was converted to a basketball court by raising the backboards, running guy wires out to the sides, and bolting the wooden parquet squares to the subflooring. Outside, along Causeway Street, scalpers were demanding upwards of $20 for tickets that usually went for $2.50. One New York sportswriter, arriving at North Station earlier that afternoon, was offered a ticket for $10 by a scalper who told him, &#x201c;Just trying to do you a favor, Mac. I can get more for it at the Garden just before game time.&#x201d;<br><br> The reason for the excitement was that twenty-three-year-old Wilt Chamberlain had joined the Philadelphia Warriors as a rookie that year and on this night Chamberlain would for the first time face the Celtics center, Bill Russell. The game was so eagerly anticipated that Red Auerbach, the Celtics coach, had been telling people that it would draw enough fans to fill Yankee Stadium. Sportswriters were calling the confrontation Battle of the Titans, Battle of the Giants, and Big Goliath vs. Little Goliath. They were speculating about what would happen when an &#x201c;irresistible offensive force&#x201d; encountered an &#x201c;immovable defensive object.&#x201d; In an article anticipating the game, Sport magazine&#x2019;s headline was &#x201c;The Big Collision,&#x201d; and it declared, &#x201c;Pro basketball will be stepping into its golden age when Wilt Chamberlain, the rookie, clashes with Bill Russell, the leaping veteran.&#x201d;<br><br> Chamberlain had attracted national attention even while a student at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, where his team won fifty-eight games and lost three in his three years there and where he set a statewide scoring record, averaging just under forty points per game. At the University of Kansas, he had proved to be such an overwhelming presence on the court that Jimmy Breslin, then a young sportswriter, wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post entitled, &#x201c;Can Basketball Survive Wilt Chamberlain?&#x201d;<br><br> Basketball had had big men before. In the early fifties, George Mikan, the six-foot-ten-inch center of the Minneapolis Lakers, had dominated the game. But Mikan was a lurching, graceless man who wore metal-rimmed glasses and lumbered up and down the court, bashing aside opponents with his huge left arm. Chamberlain was more than seven feet tall and wore size fourteen-and-a-half shoes, but he was also quick, agile, strong, and smart. His legs were so long that he seemed part gazelle. And they were so powerful that when he leaped up, arms raised, toward the backboard, his hands at the apex of his jump were three feet above the rim, which he could look down into. He was so good that not only did no one seem to be able to beat him, few people seemed actually capable of playing against him.<br><br> Except maybe Bill Russell. Russell had led the Celtics to two championships since joining the team three years earlier. Never much of a shooter, Russell had nonetheless perfected a style of defensive play, blocking shots and rebounding ferociously by leaping so high into the air that he seemed to hang there in suspension. His size and athleticism had literally transformed professional basketball. Prior to Russell joining the National Basketball Association, the game had consisted of little more than men running up and down the court making layups. But because Russell blocked layups so effectively, players had been forced to create a wider range of offensive plays, passing back and forth and setting screens until one of them could make a mid-range jump shot. The game immediately became more complex, varied, and challenging for the players and more involving and fun to watch for the spectators, and the late fifties became known as the Russell Era.<br><br> But now, with Chamberlain in the league, sportswriters were wondering if the Russell Era was coming to an end, if the defensive style of play Russell personified would yield to the singularly muscular offensive style of Wilt Chamberlain, whose fadeaway jump shot was almost impossible to defend against and who amazed fans by leaping up to the rim, taking a pass over the outstretched hands of the defending team, and then, still rising into his jump, actually shoving the ball down into the basket. It was a feat so startling, requiring such a rare combination of timing, grace, and strength, that it seemed to have more to do with acrobatics than with basketball. Until then, the sport had been thought of as a game played well below the net. Now it was becoming a game played in the air.<br><br> Russell, sitting in the Celtics locker room before the game, had read the articles musing about an end of an era&#x2014;his era, even though he was only twenty-six&#x2014;and he wondered if they were true. Russell had eaten a steak that afternoon and then played cards with his teammates Maurice King and K. C. Jones, who had also been his teammate on the University of San Francisco Dons when he led it to two NCAA championships. Russell always got nervous before a game, so nervous that he routinely threw up. Night after night, sixty or seventy times a season, he was in the head before the game tossing the remains of his lunch. In fact, he did it with such regularity that to his teammates it became a ritualistic sign of good luck. If Russell wasn&#x2019;t in there puking, they got worried.<br><br> But on this night Russell was more nervous than usual, even after the obligatory trip to the head. Russell was tall, six-ten, but Chamberlain had three or four inches on him; Russell didn&#x2019;t know exactly how many inches, because while Chamberlain was officially listed at seven feet one and one-sixteenth inches, he also claimed that no one had measured him since he was in high school. Also, Russell knew, Chamberlain was a good forty to fifty pounds heavier than he was. He could jump just as high and he was just as quick up and down the court.<br><br> And Chamberlain was smart. Russell considered himself one of the most serious students and analysts of basketball ever to play the game. While at San Francisco, he had thought so systematically about the game&#x2019;s physics and geometry&#x2014;the trajectories the ball drew between the horizontal plane of the court and the vertical planes of the backboards, the thrust of a 240-pound body hurtling at you at twenty miles an hour and the dynamics of deflecting that thrust&#x2014;that he thought of himself as a scie...</p><h2>Freeze Frame (The Enzo Files, 4)</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

Together, this extraordinary minage-`-trois spent the heady interwar period frequenting Paris, Villefranche-sur-Mer, and other European cities, meeting up with such lively personalities as Thornton Wilder, Jean Cocteau, Katherine Anne Porter, Man Ray, Reni Crevel, and Christian Birard. Inspired by the encouragement of Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Jane Heap, all three men went on to pursue vibrant careers in the arts. Platt Lynes became a celebrated photographer in 1931; Wheeler, with Wescotts sister-in-law, Barbara Harrison, started the extraordinary little press, Harrison of Paris in 1930; and Wescott became a bestselling fiction writer in 1927. The photographs represented here date from the threesomes first meeting, and underscore the intimate bond they shared. It is a story of youthfu! l passion and enthusiasm that spea ks to the enduring ties that held these three talented men together throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.</p><p>Glenway Wescott and Monroe Wheeler were an extraordinary couple, to be sure. The two met for the first time in 1919, and it was, it seems, a classic case of love at first sight. At the time, Wescott was still in his teens and Wheeler just 20. Seemingly inured to the social mores of the time and inconstancies of youth, the two embarked on a relationship that can be called nothing short of a marriage, for the next 68 years, until Wescott's death in 1987. The young couple traveled the world, stopping in on Gertrude Stein's Paris Salon and crossing paths with Jean Cocteau on the Riviera, while Wescott developed his poetry and later fiction (he authored <i>The Grandmothers</i> and <i>Pilgrim Hawk</i>, among other bestsellers of his day) and Wheeler found his path. Eventually he would become the director of publications at the Museum of Modern Art.<p> The two moved with equal ease through the literary and artistic circles of London and the continent as well as their families' Midwestern homes. That their relationship thrived is notable enough. But 1927 brought a new challenge to their pairing. High-school student George Platt Lynes fell passionately in love with the strikingly good-looking Wheeler. And Wheeler, for his part, was entranced by Lynes's "full, luscious mouth and his wasplike waist." Instead of driving a wedge between Wescott and Wheeler, as might be expected, Lynes soon became part of their shared life. When, after some casting about, he hit upon photography, the two nurtured his career and used their considerable connections to get him both work and gallery shows.</p><p> <i>When We Were Three</i> presents photographs the trio took as they traveled the world together during the late '20s and '30s. They are the subjects of many of the images, but the Great Wall of China, an Egyptian sphinx, and their numerous friends--including Stein, Cocteau, Thornton Wilder, and Katherine Anne Porter--are captured, too. Oddly, the subject, date, and location of each photograph are carefully documented, but the photographer is not. Some of the earliest-known Lyne images are here, but it is the biographical essay by Anatole Pohorilenko in the front of the book that calls this out. Still, with its high production value and informative essays by Pohorilenko and James Crump, the book is an enjoyable choice for those interested in early-20th-century photography and the lifestyle of the legendary 1930s American expatriate in Europe. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>...a beautifully produced text-and-photos compilation that is part love story, part informal cultural history and part excavation of the gay demimonde between the world wars. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Christopher Benfey</i><br><br>Surely, one of history's dynamic trios consisted of photographer George Platt Lynes, publisher Monroe Wheeler, and writer Glenway Wescott, who became friends in 1927 and spent the next several years visiting Paris and other European captals.

But this wasn&#x2019;t any kind of self-hatred thing. He&#x2019;d read The Bluest Eye and Invisible Man in school and even picked up Disgruntled at a book fair, and yes, they were good and there was some resonance in those books for him, but this story isn&#x2019;t about race or &#x201c;the shame of being alive&#x201d; or any of those things. He was not self-hating; he was even listening to Drake&#x2014;though you could make it Fetty Wap if his appreciation for trap music changes something for you, because all that&#x2019;s relevant here is that he wasn&#x2019;t against the music of &#x201c;his people&#x201d; or anything like that&#x2014;as he walked down Figueroa with his earbuds pushed in just far enough so as not feel itchy.<br> <br>Riley was wearing the wispy swooped version of his bangs and listening to Drake or Fetty, and he was black with blue contacts and bleached-blond hair. And, yes, there are black people who have both of those things naturally, without the use of artificial accouterments, so we can move past the whole phenotypically this or biologically that discussion to the meat of things. And if there is something meta in this narrator&#x2019;s consciousness and self-consciousness or this overindulgent aside, it isn&#x2019;t meta for the sake of being meta; this narrator&#x2019;s consciousness is just letting you know about said consciousness up front, like a raised black fist, to get the close reading out the way and make space for Riley, who was the kind of black man for whom blue eyes and blond hair were not natural. He was the kind of black that warranted&#x2014;or invited without solicitation&#x2014;comparisons to drinks from Starbucks or lyrics from &#x201c;Lady Marmalade&#x201d; or chocolate bars, with nuts.<br> <br>You would think with his blue contacts and unnaturally blond hair set against dark chocolate mocha-choca-latte-yaya skin&#x2014;and yes, there is some judgment in the use of &#x201c;you&#x201d;&#x2014;that Riley would date white or Asian women exclusively, or perhaps that he liked men. But you&#x2019;d be wrong on all counts, as Riley was straight, and he dated widely among black women, and he was neither in denial, nor on the down-low, nor, like John Mayer, equal opportunity and United Colors of Benetton in life but as separate as the fingers of the hand in sex, nor like Frederick Douglass or many others working on black rights in public and going home to a white wife (and there is no judgment against Douglass here, just facts for the sake of descriptive clarity). Riley liked black women, both their blackness and womanness and the overlap between those constructs; nor was Riley queerphobic or the type of man to utter &#x201c;no homo&#x201d; in uncomfortable situations, because Riley was comfortable enough, if &#x201c;enough&#x201d; expresses a sort of educated awareness. There is so much awareness in these two paragraphs that I have hardly made space for Riley, who in addition to black women liked cosplay&#x2014;dressing up as characters from his favorite books and movies&#x2014;and Dr. Who and Rurouni Kenshin and the Comic-Love convention, and especially Death Note, his favorite manga and anime series. And though that day he was dressed as Tamaki Suoh (per his girlfriend&#x2019;s request), in a skinny periwinkle suit with a skinny black tie, his appearance gave him the flexibility to on other occasions dress as Kise Ryouta or Naruto, or, if he was feeling especially bold, Super Saiyan.<br> <br>So it was bothersome, then, to Riley/Tamaki as he walked toward the Los Angeles Convention Center, when Brother Man at the corner of Figueroa and Fifteenth&#x2014;not to be confused with the Original Bruh Man, whose actual origins or current whereabouts are unknown, but Bruh Man&#x2019;s gradated type, this particular yet stock Bruh Man, Brother Man&#x2014;accosted Riley after he brushed away the pamphlet Brother Man was trying to hand him and put his hand on Riley&#x2019;s shoulder and ventured to violate Riley&#x2019;s personal space even further by using that large hand with cigarette-stained fingernails to turn Riley toward him. I am saying Brother Man stopped Riley on the street, singled him out in front of people dressed, respectively, as Princess Mononoke, Storm, Daleks, Cybermen, and Neil deGrasse Tyson (both in blackface and in their own black faces), put his hands on him, and forced him to look into Brother Man&#x2019;s own face with the familiarity of a friend yet, contextually, with the violence of a stranger.<br> <br>On any other day Riley might have acknowledged that he was wrong to walk past Brother Man&#x2019;s initial &#x201c;Howyoudoin,&#x201d; which he pretended not to hear on account of the Fetty. On this day, however, Riley felt that since he was inhabiting the character of Tamaki, his decision to ignore Brother Man was just right, an exercise in method acting.<br> <br>Riley was more than surprised&#x2014;and did not need to borrow Tamaki&#x2019;s affectations to feel slighted&#x2014;that Brother Man had touched him, and by that point, even though he might have been just the kind of buyer for what Brother Man was selling, his pride wouldn&#x2019;t let him concede.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>It had long irked Riley that his blackness or the degree of his loyalty to the cause should be suspect because he wore blue contacts and bleached his hair blond and because, on top of all that, his name was also Riley, and not, say, Tyreke. It irked him that he might be mistaken for a self-hating Uncle Tom because he enjoyed cosplay and anime and comic book conventions and because he happened to be feeling the character of a rich Japanese schoolboy a little too much at that very moment.<br> <br>By the time Brother Man said, &#x201c;Uppity, gay-looking nigga,&#x201d; Riley had bypassed logic and forgotten that he held none of the privileges of his costume.<br> <br>There ensued then what Riley, in his costume, might have called fisticuffs, though in everyday life he would have simply said they got to scrappin, right on Figueroa Street.<br> <br>The people who watched and filmed and circulated the scene from inside one of the lobbies of the convention center said it was just like Naruto v. Pain, only with two black guys, so you couldn&#x2019;t tell if either one was the hero.<br> 2.<p></p> <br>In truth Brother Man was burly but not violent and rather liked to regard himself as an intellectual in a misleading package. If he could have made a wish before the end of that day, it would have been that he, too, had worn a costume to soften the effects of his image.<br> <br>When he put his hand on Riley&#x2019;s shoulder, it was only because he disliked the sight of someone, especially one of his own, turning his back to him without hearing him out. It was also because he needed to promote Brother&#x2019;s Spawn and had thus far convinced a meager four passersby to buy a $4 copy that day, and because Brother Man felt, unapologetically, that black people should stick together and that the blue-eyed, wig-wearing brother in the purple suit should have at least acknowledged him with a nod, if not a handshake or a howyoudoin.<br> <br>Though in the aftermath, people would call his papers religious tracts, indoctrination materials, and &#x201c;some kind of gang documents,&#x201d; Brother&#x2019;s Spawn was Brother Man&#x2019;s self-published dystopian comic series set at Pasadena City College, where he first learned of Octavia Butler and her work. The comics were hand-drawn with the dimensions of a postcard, though he also hoped to sell broadsides featuring a poem he had written.<br> <br>Brother Man&#x2014;aliases Kyle Barker, Cole Brown, Overton Wakefield Jones, Tommy Strawn, and pen name Brother Hotep&#x2014;was selling the postcard comics illegally (he preferred the term &#x201c;without official city permits&#x201d;) between a food truck and a juice cart that day. On other days he sold them near the Century City Mall, in Ladera Heights, in Little Ethiopia, and as far as Inglewood.<br> <br>That day, he banked on the convention center&#x2019;s Comic-Love traffic and the potential readers it might attract, boasting to his girlfriend earlier in the morning that he would probably sell out, &#x201c;even without one of those official tables in the convention center, watch.&#x201d;<br> <br>And though he would say he was not usually the type to call Riley a sellout or an Uncle Tom, that day, Brother Man (real name Richard Simmons, yes, Richard Simmons) could not handle Riley&#x2019;s refusal to acknowledge him or his art. He could find reasons to dismiss the hundred or so people in costumes, some speaking English, some other languages, who shook their hands no at the laminated mock-ups he tried to show them, but he could not abide a black refusal, especially one from a black guy in a Japanese prep-schoolboy costume, the very kind of audience Brother Man hoped to cultivate.<br> <br>Thus, when he put his hand on Riley&#x2019;s shoulder, he never meant to hit him, and if he could, Brother Man, hereafter Richard, would have imagined that Riley didn&#x2019;t plan to fight him either. And neither man ever would have thought that amateur karate (pronounced in the authentic Japanese accent) would be involved, their arms flailing and legs kicking out in poorly choreographed mortal combat.<br> 3.<p></p> <br>On his way to a meeting, Kevan stopped at the SweetArt Bakeshop in Saint Louis to purchase a vegan brownie for himself and a purple cupcake with tiny candy hearts for his daughter Penny, who was with him for the weekend. The whole shop was lined with canvases of varying sizes, painted by the owners and sold from the bakery, which served as a gallery and community meeting space. Tiny vases holding local flowers adorned each table. Kevan wore a black T-shirt that said in white letters, &#x201c;Eff Your Respectability Politics.&#x201d; He liked the irony of the word &#x201c;eff&#x201d; instead of the F-word, but he still debated whether it was better to change &#x201c;your&#x201d; to &#x201c;yo.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t sure if anyone understood the stakes in these decisions or in any of his other art, which he sold online, from his car, and occasionally from a small suitcase in the barbershop on Washington Avenue.<br> <br>He had one hour left with Penny before her mother would pick her up so Kevan could meet a potential business partner and pitch an idea that he couldn&#x2019;t shake.<br> <br>He chose a table in the middle of the nearly empty shop, with yellow-and-green flowers in the vase. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a superhero,&#x201d; Penny said, pointing to the largest canvas on the wall adjacent to the bakery case, and inhaling another glob of frosting. The frosting accumulated at the corners of Penny&#x2019;s smile, but her tongue missed those spots each time it swept her mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s cute. Daddy can teach you to paint like this,&#x201d; Kevan said, passing Penny a napkin across the table.<br> <br>Kevan wasn&#x2019;t a vegan, but he supported black business and black art, and regarded SweetArt as a place where his own work might one day be represented. The T-shirt sales provided him a stash of petty cash, but Kevan had sold only three paintings, and that grieved him. He supported his daughter Penny with a court order and a &#x201c;real job&#x201d; as a UPS deliveryman, but he &#x201c;always took care of my responsibilities,&#x201d; even before Penny&#x2019;s mother, whom he alternately called a gold digger, that whore, and my queen, demanded official monthly payments.<br> <br>&#x201c;My superhero name is gonna be&#x201d;&#x2014;Penny paused to pull back the wrapper and expose the last quarter of the cupcake, its frosting smooshed and all the candy hearts gone&#x2014;&#x201c;my name&#x2019;s gonna be Purple. Purple Penny Powers. I will make things purple like this,&#x201d; Penny said, zapping something with her arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Purple Penny Powers.&#x201d; Kevan pretended this was cuter than it was. &#x201c;Wow.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was trying not to think about a joke he had seen earlier in the day, trying not to remember the sight of two dead bodies that had appeared casually in his news feed, trying to rehearse instead his pitch for the realization of something he had read in a book that he found in a used bookstore.<br> <br>The Afric-American Picture Gallery was a series of written sketches by William Wilson, under the pen name Ethiop and following the form of similar sketches&#x2014;which Kevan found with more research&#x2014;by James McCune Smith in The Heads of the Colored People and Jane Rustic (a.k.a. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, a black abolitionist poet and suffragist). Kevan wanted to commission painters, including mostly himself, to create a full exhibit of heads of the colored people, now and then, to take the written, literary work and render it visually. The idea intrigued him, the heads talking to him like the books in Equiano&#x2014;though he didn&#x2019;t know that reference yet.<br> <br>In Kevan&#x2019;s collection, there would be, as in Ethiop&#x2019;s original, Phyllis Wheatley, Nat Turner, and a doctor, but he would update his favorite sketch, &#x201c;Picture 26,&#x201d; of the &#x201c;colored youth&#x201d; who was &#x201c;surrounded by abject wretchedness&#x201d; to reflect a sort of current abjection. To these he would add a superhero for Penny and a collage of the black men (and women, he would concede, with some coaxing later from Paris Larkin) who had been killed by police and other brutalities.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now what&#x2019;s your name going to be?&#x201d; Penny&#x2019;s voice seemed especially shrill at the moment.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Kevan was still thinking about the bodies and the grainy video of the two men arguing and the way one of the men had held out his hand when the police officer entered the scene; it was clear that the man wasn&#x2019;t holding a gun or a knife, but something soft, like paper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy, your name,&#x201d; Penny demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Kevan repeated, and blurted out the first thing that came to his mind: &#x201c;Bruh Man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bruh Man?&#x201d; Penny jutted her head back. &#x201c;What does he do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He paints, and whatever he wishes, he can paint it and make it happen.&#x201d; Kevan made Penny lick a napkin so he could wipe the leftover icing from her face. &#x201c;And he can make bad things unhappen, if he paints them right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s gonna be my power, too,&#x201d; Penny said, pulling away from his grooming and hesitating in the way of five-year-olds, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m just gonna think and make it happen or unhappen.&#x201d;<br> <br>He wished briefly that things were so simple and then began to outline something on a napkin.<br> 4.<p></p> <br>Paris Larkin was meeting Riley at the convention center after two shifts at her part-time job for Dark Shadows Hollywood Cemetery Tours.

It was one of the things that had attracted him to her when they first met, her dark cheeriness and her nonjudgmental approach to his lifestyle. And his soft-landing punch lines were one of the things Paris liked about him, and his interesting face, and the way he wasn&#x2019;t at all who she expected him to be.<br> <br>When he took his contact lenses out at night and tied his hair down with a durag, Riley looked just as comfortable and kind as when he dressed up and hung out at his favorite comic caf� in Pasadena, drinking boba tea and playing chess with kids from Caltech, where he studied engineering and was one of a handful of black students on campus.<br> <br>If Paris could have a superpower, it would be to make herself visible, because even though she stood at the front of the bus with a microphone, pointing out alleged sightings of Marilyn Monroe to hungry tourists with camera phones and fake Gucci sunglasses, she wasn&#x2019;t the main attraction, and sh...</p><h2>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</h2><p>Over a 1,000,000 copies sold. can be shipped in 1-2 days.</p><p>Carl Sagan muses on the current state of scientific thought, which offers him marvelous opportunities to entertain us with his own childhood experiences, the newspaper morgues, UFO stories, and the assorted flotsam and jetsam of pseudoscience.

Originally published as a paperback in 1961, it has long been treasured by World War II buffs and professional historians for its insights into the Japanese side of the surface war in the Pacific. The book has been credited with correcting errors in U.S. accounts of various battles and with revealing details of high-level Imperial Japanese Navy strategy meetings. The author, Captain Tameichi Hara, was a survivor of more than one hundred sorties against the Allies and was known throughout Japan as the Unsinkable Captain. Called the workhorses of the navy, Japanese destroyers shouldered the heaviest burden of the surface war and took part in scores of intense sea battles, many of which Captain Hara describes here. In the early days of the war victories were common, but by 1943, the lack of proper maintenance of the destroyers and sufficient supplies, along with Allied development of scientific equipment and superior aircraft, took its toll. On April 7, 1945, during the Japanese navy s last sortie, Captain Hara managed to survive the sinking of his own ship only to witness the demise of the famed Japanese battleship Yamato off Okinawa. A hero to his countrymen, Captain Hara exemplified the best in Japanese surface commanders: highly skilled (he wrote the manual on torpedo warfare), hard driving, and aggressive. Moreover, he maintained a code of honor worthy of his samurai grandfather, and, as readers of this book have come to appreciate, he was as free with praise for American courage and resourcefulness as he was critical of himself and his senior commanders. The book s popularity over the past forty-six years testifies to the author s success at writing an objective account of what happened that provides not only a fascinating eyewitness record of the war, but also an honest and dispassionate assessment of Japan s high command. Captain Hara s sage advice on leadership is as applicable today as it was when written. For readers new to this book and for those who have read and re-read their paperback editions until they have fallen apart, this new hardcover edition assures them a permanent source of reference and enjoyment.</p><p>Fred Saito translated and expanded the original manuscript, after spending more than eight hundred hours interviewing Captain Hara, to make the book as full and accurate an account as possible. Saito was a journalist with the Tokyo office of the Associated Press from 1948 to 1960 and later served on the staff of the Japan Broadcasting Company. He also translated Samurai!, the story of one of Japan s greatest fighter pilots by Saburo Sakai and Martin Caidin. Roger Pineau served in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II. After the war, he became a member of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey in Japan and later assisted Adm. Samuel Eliot Morison in preparing the authoritative History of the United States Naval Operations in World War II. Pineau added the footnotes to Captain Hara s memoir, including the names of U.S. ships and commanders that engaged the captain s forces, and checked the accuracy of the battle accounts. He also assisted with the writing and fact checking of two other books by Japanese authors about the war, The Divine Wind and Midway.</p><h2>In the Company of Others</h2><p>Of all her bestselling novels, Jan Karon says In the Company of Others, this &#34;dark-haired child,&#34; is her favorite-a sentiment readers everywhere are certain to share.

The room was cool, even chill compared to the ever-present heat of the city. Painted ceramic tiles lined the walls. A mismatched jumble of wooden benches and shelves that had clearly seen decades of abuse made it feel well loved if not well cared for. Were �eda any other dirt dog, she would have sat in one of the rooms on the far side of the pits, the ones that hosted dozens of men and women. But �eda was given special dispensation, and had been since winning her first bout at the age of fourteen.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>By the gods, five years already.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> She tightened her hands into fists, enjoying the creak of the leather, the feel of the chain mail wrapped around the backs of her hands and knuckles. She checked the straps of her armor. Her greaves, her bracers, her heavy battle skirt. And finally her breastplate. All of them had once been dyed white&#x2014;the color of a wolf&#x2019;s bared teeth&#x2014;but now the armor was so well used that much of the leather&#x2019;s natural brown shone through.&nbsp;<i>Well and good</i>, �eda thought. It felt used. Lived in. Kissed by battle. Exactly the way she liked it.<br> &nbsp;<br> She picked up her bright steel helm and set it on her lap. She stared into the iron mask fixed across the front&#x2014;a mask of a woman&#x2019;s face, cold and expressionless in the face of battle. Affixed to the top of the helm was a wolf&#x2019;s pelt, teeth bared, muzzle resting along the crown.<br> &nbsp;<br> Echoing down the corridor came a voice that sounded old and hoary, a mountain come to life. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d; It was Pelam.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda glanced toward the arched doorway with the blood-red curtains strung across it. &#x201c;Coming,&#x201d; she said, then returned her attention to the helm. She ran her fingers over the many nicks in the metal, over the mask&#x2019;s empty eyes&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Tulathan grant me foresight.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x2014;</i>stroked the rough fur of the wolf&#x2019;s pelt&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Thaash guide my sword.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;then pulled the helm over her braided black hair and strapped it tightly on.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the weight of the armor settled over her, she parted the heavy curtains and hiked up the sloping tunnel into the heat of the noontime sun. The walls of the fighting pit towered around her, and above them, arranged in concentric circles, were the seats of the stadium.&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s going to be a good day for Osman</i>. Already there were several hundred waiting for the bout to begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roughly half the spectators called the city of Sharakhai home; they knew the pits inside and out, knew the regular dirt dogs as well. The other half were visitors to the desert&#x2019;s amber jewel. They&#x2019;d come to trade or find fortune in a city that offered greater opportunities than they&#x2019;d had back home. It rankled that so many came here, to �eda&#x2019;s home, and lived off it like fleas on a dog. Though she could hardly complain&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> A boy in a teal kaftan pointed to �eda wildly and called, &#x201c;The White Wolf! The Wolf has come to fight!&#x201d; and the crowd rose to their feet as one, craning their necks to see.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;the pits paid well enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> A ragged cheer went up as she strode to the center of the pit and joined the circle of eleven other fighters. The money men in the stands began calling out odds for the White Wolf. She hadn&#x2019;t even been chosen to fight yet, so no one would know who her opponent would be, but many still flocked to be the first to wager their coin on her.<br> &nbsp;<br> The other dirt dogs watched �eda warily. Some knew her, but just like those in the audience, many of these fighters had come from distant kingdoms to try their hand against the best fighters in Sharakhai. Three women stood among those gathered&#x2014;two well muscled, the third an absolute brute; she outweighed �eda by three stone at least. The rest were men, some brawny, others lithe. One, however, was a tower of a man wearing a beaten leather breastplate and a conical helm with chain mail that lapped against his broad shoulders. Haluk. He stood a full head and a half taller than �eda and stared at her like an ox readying a charge.<br> &nbsp;<br> In response, �eda strode toward him and pressed her thumb to an exposed edge on the back of her mailed gloves. She pressed hard enough to pierce skin, to draw blood. Haluk stared at her with confusion, then a wicked sort of glee, as �eda stopped in front of him and pressed her bloody thumb to the center of his leather breastplate.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd roared.<br> &nbsp;<br> A new flurry of betting rose, while the rest of the audience jockeyed for position against the rim of the pit.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda had just marked Haluk for her own, an ancient gesture that not all dirt dogs would respect, but these would, she reckoned. None of them would wish to fight Haluk, not in their first bout of the day. When �eda turned away and returned to her place in the circle, all but ignoring Haluk, the naked anger on his face was slowly replaced with a look of cool assessment.&nbsp;<i>Good,&nbsp;</i>�eda thought. He&#x2019;d taken the bait and would surely choose her if she didn&#x2019;t choose him first.<br> &nbsp;<br> When some but not all of the betting flurry had died down, Pelam stepped out from another darkened tunnel. The calls of betting rose to a tumult as the audience saw the first bout was ready to begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pelam wore a jeweled vest, a brown kufi, and a red kaftan that was not only fashionable but fine, save for its hem, which was hopelessly dusty from its days sweeping the pit floors. In one of Pelam&#x2019;s skeletal hands he held a woven basket. As the fighters parted for him, he stepped to the rough center of their circle and flipped the basket lid open. After one last check around him to ensure all was ready, he shot his hand into basket&#x2019;s confines and lifted a horned viper as long as his lanky legs. The snake wriggled, swelling its hood and hissing, baring its fangs for all to see.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pelam knew his business, but the snake made �eda&#x2019;s hackles rise. Bites were rare but not unheard of, especially if one of the fighters was inexperienced and jumped when the snake drew near. �eda knew enough to remain still, but foreigners didn&#x2019;t always follow Pelam&#x2019;s careful pre-bout instructions, and it wasn&#x2019;t always the person who jumped that the snakes chose to sink their fangs into.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Pelam held the writhing snake, each of the fighters spread their legs wide until their sandaled or booted feet butted up against each other&#x2019;s. After a glance at each of the fighter&#x2019;s stances, and finding them proper, Pelam dropped the snake and stepped away.<br> &nbsp;<br> It lay there, coiling itself tightly. The crowd shouted to the baked desert air, their voices rising to a fever pitch as each yelled the name of their chosen fighter. The fighters themselves remained silent. Oddly, the snake slithered toward Pelam for a moment, then seemed to think better of it and turned to glide over the sand to �eda&#x2019;s left, then turned once more. And slithered straight through Haluk&#x2019;s legs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Silence followed as a pit boy ran and snatched the viper by its tail, lowering it back into its basket as the snake spun like a woodworker&#x2019;s auger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pelam calmly awaited Haluk&#x2019;s choice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The big man didn&#x2019;t hesitate. He made straight for �eda and spat on the ground at her feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd went wild. &#x201c;The Oak of the Guard has chosen the White Wolf!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oak indeed. Haluk was a captain of the Silver Spears, and a tree of a man, but he was also a particularly&nbsp;<i>cruel</i>&nbsp;man, and it was time he learned a lesson.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like jackals to a kill, the news drew spectators from neighboring pits. The stands were soon brimming with them.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the rest of the fighters exited the pit, a dozen boys jogged out from the tunnels bearing wooden swords and shields and clubs. �eda, as the challenged, would normally be allowed to choose weapons first, but she followed ancient custom; she had marked him, and thus&nbsp;<i>she</i>&nbsp;was the true challenger, not Haluk, so she bowed her head and waved to the weapons, granting first choice to Haluk. <br> &nbsp;<br> Most would have returned the honor, but Haluk merely grunted and chose one of the few weapons meant for both him and his opponent: the fetters.<br> &nbsp;<br> The noise of the crowd rose until it was akin to thunder. Some laughed, others clapped. Some few even stared with naked worry at �eda, who had clearly just been put at a severe disadvantage by Haluk&#x2019;s choice of weapon.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fetters was a length of tough, braided leather. It was wrapped tightly around one of each fighter&#x2019;s wrists, keeping them in close proximity and ensuring a brawl.<br> &nbsp;<br> While glaring intently at Haluk, �eda held out her left hand, allowing Pelam to slip the end of the fetters around her wrist and tighten it. Pelam did the same to Haluk, then took a small brass gong and mallet from one of the boys.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pit was cleared so that only �eda, Haluk, and Pelam remained.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doors to the tunnels closed.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then, after a dramatic pause in which Pelam held the gong chest-high between the two fighters, he struck it and stepped away.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was slack in the fetters, a situation Haluk would quickly attempt to remedy&#x2014;his best hope, after all, lay in controlling �eda&#x2019;s movement&#x2014;but �eda was ready for it. The moment Haluk lunged in to grab as much of the leather rope as he could, she darted forward, leaping and snapping a kick at his chin. When he retreated, �eda charged, a move he clearly hadn&#x2019;t been expecting. His eyes widened as �eda grabbed his clumsily raised arm and sent her fist crashing into his cheek.<br> &nbsp;<br> She could feel the chain mail dig deep into the fighting gloves she wore, but it was worse for Haluk. He fell unceremoniously onto his rump, his conical helm flying off and thumping onto the dry dirt, kicking up dust as it went.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd stood and howled its delight.<br> &nbsp;<br> As his helm skidded well out of reach, Haluk rolled backward over his shoulder and came to a stand, so quickly that �eda had no time to rush forward and end it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk raised one hand to his cheek, felt the blood from the patterned cuts the mail had left in his skin, then stared at his own hand with a look like he&#x2019;d disappointed himself. And then his eyes went hard. He&#x2019;d been pure bluster before, trying to intimidate �eda, but now he was seething mad.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>None so blind as a wrathful man</i>, �eda thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk crouched warily and began wrapping the fetters around his left wrist, over and over, slowly taking up the slack. �eda retreated and pulled hard on the fetters, putting her entire body into it, making the leather scrape painfully along Haluk&#x2019;s arm. He ignored it and continued to wrap the restraints around his wrist. �eda yanked on the fetters again, but he blunted the tactic with well-timed grips on the leather, the muscles along his arm rippling and bulging. He grinned, showing two rows of ragged teeth.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda sent several kicks toward his thighs and knees, attacks meant more to test Haluk&#x2019;s reflexes than anything else. Haluk blocked them easily. She was just about to yank on the fetters again when he loosened his grip and rushed her. �eda stumbled, pretending to lose her balance, and when Haluk came close she dove to her right and swept a leg across his ankles.<br> &nbsp;<br> He fell in a heap, the breath whooshing from his lungs.<br> &nbsp;<br> He grabbed for �eda and managed to snag her ankle, but one swift kick from �eda&#x2019;s free heel and she was up and dancing away while Haluk rose slowly to his feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd howled again, many of the foreigners joining in, though they had no idea why. The Sharakhani knew, though. They understood why bouts like this were so very rare.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk hadn&#x2019;t been defeated in more than ten years of fighting in the pits. �eda had rarely lost since her first bout, and she&#x2019;d lost none in the past three years. Everyone knew how widely the story of this bout would be told, especially if �eda took him in so cleanly a fashion. Few would dare utter the tale within Haluk&#x2019;s hearing, but the entire city would be alive with it by the end of the day.<br> &nbsp;<br> And Haluk knew it. He stared into �eda&#x2019;s eyes with an intensity that reeked of desperation. He would not be so easy to take again.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the two of them squared off once more, the crowd went completely and eerily silent. The only sound was of Haluk&#x2019;s ragged breathing and �eda&#x2019;s strong but controlled breaths from within the confines of her helm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk took one tentative step forward. �eda stepped away, snatching up some of the slack in the fetters as she went. Haluk did the same until they both held a quarter of the length in reserve, leaving them a scant few strides from one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk took two measured steps toward her. He was trying to close the distance, but he was no longer reckless. He was cautious, as a man who&#x2019;d become a captain of Sharakhai&#x2019;s guard&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;be.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda kicked at his legs again, connecting but doing little damage. That wasn&#x2019;t the point, though. She had to keep him on his guard until she was ready to move in. She snapped another kick and retreated, but she could only go so far. Haluk had drawn up more of the fetters, so �eda released some of hers. Haluk strode forward, taking up more of the braided rope. Which forced �eda to release more. Until she had none left.<br> &nbsp;<br> He drew sharply on it, keeping his center low, his balance steady, and �eda was drawn forward until she was just out of his striking range.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd began to stamp their feet, the sound of it reverberating in the pit, but otherwise they were silent, rapt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk pulled again, harder now that they were so close. And that&#x2019;s when �eda moved.<br><br></p></p><h2>God&#39;s Country (The Callaloo Series)</h2><p>In his stunning new novel God's Country, Percival Everett offers a wickedly funny rewrite of the Great American western.<br>The unlikely narrator through this tale of misadventures is one Curt Marder: gambler, drinker, cheat, and would-be womanizer. He has lost his farm, his wife, and his dog to a band of marauding hooligans. With nothing to live on but a desire to recover what is rightfully his, Marder is forced to enlist the help of the best tracker in the West: a black man named Bubba.<br>This odd couple is soon joined by Jake, a wayward child determined to join the hunt. As Jake and Marder follow Bubba across desolate, unsettled land, they meet Indians, settlers, and soldiers. Aiming to keep a low profile, they nevertheless find themselves in all kinds of trouble, including run-ins with a scurrilous preacher, a flamboyant prostitute, and General Custer in a nightgown.<br>A natural coward, Marder only survives these incidents because of Bubba's reluctant heroism. However, even after their final, chilling exchange, Marder fails to realize that Bubba's secrets extend beyond his ability to track footprints on the prairie.<br>God's Country is hilarious and haunting by turns, a slam-bang parable of the way things were in 1871.</p><p>Percival Everett teaches at the University of California, Riverside, and at the Bennington Writing Workshop.A politically incorrect rancher hires a black man named Bubba to track down the desperadoes who burned out his homestead and carried off his wife in this hilarious, biting sendup of the formula western. Everett (The One That Got Away, 1992, etc.) effectively lampoons the mythology of the Old West. When cowardly Curt ``Dirt'' Marder espies a band of ``Injun impersonators'' pillaging his home, he has ``half a mind to ride down that hill and say somethin', but it was just half a mind after all.'' Bubba, the best tracker in the territory, agrees to help Marder in exchange for half his homestead. Marder makes the deal, though he's pretty sure it's illegal ``for a nigger to own land.'' Of course, he loses all his property in a poker game, but he doesn't tell Bubba. They set out on the trail in the company of little Jake, a tow-headed boy whose ma and pa had been killed by the same bad guys. As the pointed silliness unfolds, Everett spikes the clich&#x201a;s of the Wild West with zest: A band of Indians gets the giggles when Marder greets them with a stern-faced, ``How!''; Army Sgt. Rip Phardt leads Marder to Col. George Armstrong Custer, who's later discovered in drag; and characters such as the grizzled Epiphany Jones and a Jewish cardsharp named Greenfield parade past. ``Damn if this frontier weren't just lousy with comedians'' writes the author. But Everett shows the dark side, too, with the rape and abduction of Jake; the brutal lynching of an innocent black teenager; the wholesale massacre of an Indian village by Custer and his soldiers on ``a killin' drunk''; and Marder's resolve to do his ``American duty'' about Bubba, ``a nigger what's gone wild.'' The abruptly downbeat, surrealistic ending doesn't work, but Everett's aim is generally true, and as a spoof, this tale hits the mark. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It was a most unfortunate remark for a father to make in front of his daughters, and Baron Jamison realized his blunder as soon as the words were out of his mouth. He was, of course, immediately made sorry for blurting out his unkind comment. </p><p> Three of his four daughters had already taken to heart the foul gossip about Alec Kincaid. They didn't much care for their father's view on the atrocity, either. The baron's twins, Agnes and Alice, wept loudly and, as was their particularly irritating habit, in unison as well, while their usually sweet-tempered sister Mary marched a brisk path around the oblong table in the great hall, where their confused father sat slumped over a goblet of guilt-soothing ale. In between the twins' noisy choruses of outrage, his gentle little Mary interjected one sinful tattle after another she'd heard about the Highland warrior who would be arriving at their home in a paltry week's time. </p><p> Mary, deliberately or nay, was stirring the twins into a full lather of snorting and screeching. It was enough to try the patience of the devil himself. </p><p> Papa tried to give the Scotsman his full defense. Since he'd never actually met the warrior, or heard anything but ill, unrepeatable rumors about the man's black character, he was therefore forced to make up all his favorable remarks. </p><p> And all for naught. </p><p> Aye, it was wasted effort on his part, for his daughters weren't paying the least attention to what he was saying. That shouldn't have surprised him, he realized with a grunt and a good belch; his angels never listened to his opinions. </p><p> The baron was terribly inept at soothing his daughters when they were in a state, a fact that hadn't particularly bothered him until today. Now however, he felt it most important to gain the upper hand. He didn't want to look the fool in front of his uninvited guests, be they Scots or nay, and fool he'd certainly be called if his daughters continued to ignore his instructions. </p><p> After downing a third gulp of ale, the baron summoned up a bit of gumption. He slammed his fist down on the wooden table as an attention-getter, then announced that all this talk about the Scotsman being a murderer was nonsense. </p><p> When that statement didn't get any reaction or notice, his irritation got the better of him. All right, then, he decided, if all the gossip turned true, then mayhap the Scotsman's wife had been deserving of the foul deed. It had probably just started out as a proper thrashing, he speculated, and as things had a way of doing, the beating had gotten a wee bit out of hand. </p><p> That explanation made perfectly good sense to Baron Jamison. His comments gained him an attentive audience, too, but the incredulous looks on his daughters' faces weren't the result he'd hoped to accomplish. His precious angels stared at him in horror, as if they'd just spotted a giant leech hanging off the tip of his nose. They thought him daft, he suddenly realized. The baron's weak temper exploded full measure then, and he bellowed that the sorry woman had probably sassed her lord back once too often. It was a lesson that his disrespectful daughters would do well to take to heart. </p><p> The baron had only meant to put the fear of God and father into his daughters. He knew he'd failed in the extreme when the twins started shouting again. The sound made his head ache. He cupped his hands over his ears to block out the grating noise, then closed his eyes against the hot glare Mary was giving him. The baron actually slumped lower in his chair, until his knobby knees were scraping the floor. His head was bent, his gumption gone, and in desperation, he turned to his faithful servant, Herman, and ordered him to fetch his youngest daughter. </p><p> The gray-haired servant looked relieved by the order, nodding several times before shuffling out of the room to do his lord's bidding. The baron could have sworn on the Holy Cross that he heard the servant mutter under his breath that it was high time that order was given. </p><p> A scant ten minutes elapsed before the baron's namesake walked into the middle of the chaos. Baron Jamison immediately straightened in his chair. After giving Herman a good glare to let him know he'd heard his whispered criticism, he let go of his scowl. And when he turned to watch his youngest, he let out a long sigh of relief. </p><p> His Jamie would take charge. </p><p> Baron Jamison realized he was smiling now, then admitted to himself that it just wasn't possible to stay sour when his Jamie was near. </p><p> She was such a bewitching sight, so pleasing to look upon, in fact, that a man could forget all his worries. Her presence was as commanding as her beauty, too. Jamie had been endowed with her mama's handsome looks. She had long raven-colored hair, violet eyes that reminded her papa of springtime, and skin as flawless and pure as her heart. </p><p> Although the baron boasted of loving all his daughters, in secret, Jamie was his pride and joy. It was a most amazing fact, considering he wasn't her true blood father. Jamie's mother was the baron's second wife. She had come to him when she was nearly full term with her daughter. The man who'd fathered Jamie had died in battle, a bare month after wedding and bedding his bride. </p><p> The baron had accepted the infant as his own, forbidding anyone to refer to her as his stepdaughter. From the moment he'd first held her in his arms, she had belonged to him. </p><p> Jamie was the youngest and the most magnificent of his angels. The twins, and Mary as well, were gifted with a quiet beauty, the kind that grew on a man with time and notice, but his dear little Jamie, with just one look, could fairly knock the wind out of a man. Her smile had been known to nudge a knight clear off his mount, or so her papa liked to exaggerate to his friends. </p><p> Yet there was no petty jealousy among his girls. Agnes, Alice, and Mary instinctively turned to their little sister for guidance in all matters of significance. They leaned on her almost as often as their papa did. </p><p> Jamie was now the true mistress of their home. Since the day of her mama's burial, his youngest had taken on that burden. She'd proven her value early, and the baron, liking order but having no gift for establishing it, had been most relieved to give Jamie full responsibility. </p><p> She never disappointed him. Jamie was such a sensible, untroubling daughter. She never cried, either, not since the day her mama passed on. Agnes and Alice would have done well to learn from their sister's disciplined nature, the baron thought. They tended to cry over just about everything. To his mind, their looks saved them from being completely worthless, but still he pitied the lords who would someday be saddled with his emotional daughters. </p><p> The baron worried most for his Mary. Though he never voiced the criticism, he knew she was a might more selfish than was considered fashionable. She put her own wants above those of her sisters. The bigger sin, however, was putting herself above her papa. </p><p> Aye, Mary was a worry, and a mischief-maker, too. She liked to plow up trouble just for the sheer joy of it. The baron had a nagging suspicion that Jamie was giving Mary unladylike ideas, but he never dared voice that notion, lest he be proven wrong, and fall from grace in his youngest's eyes. </p><p> Yet even though Jamie was his favorite, the baron wasn't completely oblivious to her flaws. Her temper, though seldom unleashed, could ignite a forest fire. She had a stubborn crook in her nature, too. She had inherited her mama's skill for healing, even though he'd specifically forbidden that practice. Nay, the baron wasn't pleased with that inclination, for the serfs and the house servants were constantly pulling her away from her primary duty of seeing to his comforts.

To meet the needs of an increasingly technology-savvy public, Fortress Press presents widely-used volumes in a new CD-ROM format. Features include: The complete, searchable text of the book; glossary hyperlinked to key words in the text; additional study questions; student helps for writing papers; internet links to additional resources; note-taking, bookmarking, and highlighting capabilities. <p>The completely revised and updated version of Johnson&#x2019;s very successful introduction to the New Testament (1999) is now available with a CD-ROM that contains the entire original text with copious searching and researching features, plus hyper-links to the NRSV. Johnson organizes his presentation in six major sections: </p><p>(1) The Symbolic World of the New Testament, (2) The Christian Experience, (3) The Synoptic Tradition, (4) Pauline Traditions, (5) Other Canonical Witnesses, and (6) The Johannine Tradition.</p></p><p>Luke Timothy Johnson is the Robert W. Woodruff Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. He has also written for Fortress Press Religious Experience in Earliest Christianity, among others.I have written this book for those who want to understand the origin and shape of the New Testament writings but are unable to find a comprehensive introduction that is neither repellingly technical nor appallingly trivial. I have called it an interpretation rather than an introduction for the simple reason that most volumes going by the name of introduction are either handbooks devoted to the communication of information concerning a narrow range of scholarly issues or popularized versions of conventional scholarly wisdom for college students. In contrast to both, I have tried to provide a genuine interpretation of Christianity's earliest writings. By so doing I draw the reader into the most important critical questions concerning their understanding. In this sense, every interpretation is also an introduction. By no means is every introduction an interpretation. <p>The organization of this book, its argument, and the choice of topics have all been dictated by the desire to make these writings intelligible and alive for the contemporary reader who want to meet and understand them more than scholarly discussions of them. I have considered all the critical issues pertinent to the understanding of the writings, but I have gone beyond presenting a consensus of scholarly opinion. The reader will find in these pages a signal "reading" of the evidence from beginning to end---my own. My approach to the writings and the critical issues is independent. It is not, I think, idiosyncratic. I have learned more than I can ever credit to my teachers and to the reading of other scholars. But in this book I advance my own understanding of the New Testament in its origin, in each of its parts, and as a collection. Sometimes I agree with the majority of scholars; sometimes I disagree. I have tried to indicate the reasons for both. As in every attempt to deal with the whole of a subject within a reasonable space, much has been eliminated or abbreviated. More advanced readers should recognize in my sometimes elliptical remarks a thoughtful response to critical scholarship. </p><p>In order to keep my argument and presentation clean I have not used footnotes, nor do I refer to other scholars by name in the text. The reader will, I hope, forgive the inevitable air of omniscience that results. It seemed better to restrict reference to primary sources, above all the texts of the New Testament itself. Occasionally even these are so numerous as to make the detection of decent prose a problem. At the end of each chapter I have provided an annotated bibliography. Some entries support my presentation, others provide alternative points of view, still other give the reader additional resources for study. With very few exceptions I have included only literature in English, since the notes are meant to be an aid to the reader rather than a demonstration of learning. Given the rate of translation, not that much of great value is missing. I have also tried to refer to literature that is reasonably available. Translations of primary sources are acknowledged at the head of each bibliographical section. ---Preface to First Edition </p><p>The first edition of The Writings of the New Testament: An Interpretation appeared in 1986. The manuscript for that edition was completed in 1984. The bibliographies were fairly up-to-date but included only a few items from 1984. The contents of the books are therefore almost fifteen years old. Despite the usefulness of the first edition---it went through thirteen printings---it is clearly time for a new edition. </p><p>I have not changed the basic philosophy or design of the book. I have simply tried to update and improve it. The updating takes two basic forms. The first is the completely revised bibliographies. Some older items are eliminated; many more recent items are included. I have continued to use only English-language references for the reasons stated in the first edition. The second updating is found in two appendices. One deals with newer methods that have developed over the past fifteen years; it is only a sketch but it shows the general lines of development and its bibliography provides some starting points for reading. The other appendix deals with the question of the Historical Jesus. I explain why I continue to omit this topic from the body of the book, and try to indicate some of the critical questions and sources to consult. </p><p>The improvement of the book is found in the line-by-line editing. Every sentence has been assessed for accuracy and clarity. Many passages have been rewritten, some have been omitted, some added. The argument of each chapter remains the same, though I hope it is clearer and more accessible. All of the references have been checked and corrected. I have also added study questions at the end of each chapter to make the book an even better teaching tool. ---Preface to Revised Edition</p></p><h2>The Devil Amongst the Lawyers: A Ballad Novel (Ballad Novels)</h2><p><p>In 1935, when Erma Morton, a beautiful young woman with a teaching degree, is charged with the murder of her father in a remote Virginia mountain community, the case becomes a cause c�l�bre<i> </i>for the national press.</p><p>&nbsp;Eager for a case to replace the Lindbergh trial in the public&#x2019;s imagination, the journalists descend on the mountain county intent on infusing their stories with quaint local color: horse-drawn buggies, rundown shacks, children in threadbare clothes. They need tales of rural poverty to give their Depression-era readers people whom they can feel superior to. The untruth of these cultural stereotypes did not deter the big-city reporters, but a local journalist, Carl Jennings, fresh out of college and covering his first major story, reports what he sees: an ordinary town and a defendant who is probably guilty. </p><p>This journey to a distant time and place summons up ghosts from the reporters&#x2019; pasts:&nbsp; Henry Jernigan&#x2019;s sojourn in Japan that ended in tragedy, Shade Baker&#x2019;s hardscrabble childhood on the Iowa prairie, and Rose Hanelon&#x2019;s brittle sophistication, a shield for her hopeless love affair. While they spin their manufactured tales of squalor, Carl tries to discover the truth in the Morton trial with the help of his young cousin Nora, who has the Sight. But who will believe a local cub reporter whose stories contradict the nation&#x2019;s star journalists?&nbsp;For the reader, the novel resonates with the present: an economic depression, a deadly flu epidemic, a world contending with the rise of political fanatics, and a media culture determined to turn news stories into soap operas for the diversion of the masses.</p><p>A stunning&nbsp;return to the lands,&nbsp;ballads, and characters&nbsp;upon which she made her name, <i>The Devil Amongst the Lawyers</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a testament to Sharyn McCrumb&#x2019;s lyrical and evocative&nbsp;writing.</p></p><p><p>Sharyn McCrumb is the author of <i>The Ballad of Frankie Silver</i><i>, She Walks These Hills,</i> and many other award-winning novels.&nbsp;Her books have been named Notable Books of the Year by <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. She was&nbsp;named&nbsp;a &#x201c;Virginia Woman of History&#x201d; for achievement in literature in 2008.&nbsp;She lives and writes in the Virginia Blue Ridge, less than a hundred miles from where her family settled in 1790 in the Smoky Mountains that divide North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>ONE<br>NARROW ROAD TO A FAR PROVINCE<br>&nbsp;<br>Each day is a journey, and the journey itself home.<br>&#x2014;MATSUO BASH?<br>&nbsp;<br>Two hours west of Washington, Henry Jernigan finally gave up on his book. This Mr. John Fox, Jr., might have been a brilliant author&#x2014;although personally he doubted it&#x2014;but the clattering of the train shook the page so much that he found himself reading the same tiresome line over and over until his head began to ache. The November chill seemed to seep through the sides of the railroad car, and even in his leather gloves and overcoat, he did not feel warm.<br>He thought of taking a fortifying nip of brandy from the silver flask secreted in his coat pocket, but he was afraid of depleting his supply, when he was by no means sure that he could obtain another bottle in the benighted place that was his destination. Prohibition had been repealed eighteen months ago, but he had heard that some of these backwoods places still banned liquor by local ordinance. He repressed a shudder. Imagine trying to live in such a place, sober.<br>A man lay dead in some one-horse town in the mountains of southwest Virginia. Well, what of it?<br>The only thing that made death interesting was the details.<br>In point of fact, the death of a stranger no longer interested Henry Jernigan at all. In all his years on the job he had seen too many permutations of death to take much of an interest anymore, but even if the emotion was lacking, the skill to recount it was still there in force. Jernigan would supply the telling particulars of the story; his readers could furnish the tears. All that really mattered to him these days was a decent dinner, a clean and quiet place to sleep, and a flask of spirits to insulate him from the tedium of it all.<br>He brushed a speck of cigar ash from the sleeve of his black wool coat. Henry Jernigan may have been sent to the back of beyond by an unfeeling philistine editor, but by god that didn&#x2019;t mean he had to go there looking like a yokel. True, his starched linen shirt was sweaty and rumpled from the vicissitudes of a crowded winter train ride, and his shoes, hand-stitched leather from a cobbler in Baltimore, glistened with mud and coal grit, but he fancied that the essential worth of his wardrobe, and thus of himself, would shine through the shabbiness of the suit and the dust of the road. Henry Jernigan was a gentleman. A gentleman of the press, perhaps, but still a gentleman.<br>He looked without favor at the book in his lap, and with a sigh he closed it, marking his place only because he was reading Fox&#x2019;s novel for research, not for plea sure. After sixty interminable pages he had begun to think of the book as &#x201c;The Trail of the Loathsome Pine,&#x201d; a quip he planned to spring on his colleagues as soon as he met up with them. At last winter&#x2019;s trial in New Jersey, clever but ugly Rose Hanelon had made a similar play on words with a Gene Stratton Porter title. When the family governess had committed suicide, Rose took to referring to her as the &#x201c;Girl of the Lindbergh-Lost.&#x201d;<br>No doubt Rose was on her way here, as well. He thought of going to look for her on his way to the dining car when it was closer to dinnertime. At least one need not lack for civilized conversation, even in the hinterlands.<br>He knew all the big wheels on the major papers, of course. The places changed, but the faces and the greasy diner food stayed the same, no matter where they went. He didn&#x2019;t see those smug jackals from the New York Journal American, though. That was odd. The word was that the Hearst syndicate had paid for an exclusive on this trial, so he had expected to see their people. Either they had already arrived, or they had what they needed and went home, relying on local stringers to send them the facts of the trial.<br>Henry&#x2019;s paper seemed ready to fight them for dominance of the story, though. They had even assigned one of the World Tele gram photographers to accompany him to this godforsaken place.<br>Rose Hanelon of the Herald Tribune would be here, though. Henry was fond of Rose. While technically she was a competitor, they got along well, and he flattered himself that his serious readers and the sentimental followers of her sob sister columns were worlds apart, so that, in fact, no rivalry existed. He even looked the other way when Rose slipped Shade Baker a few bucks to take photos for her, too.<br>The brotherhood of the Fourth Estate: it was as close to a family as Henry had these days. He went back to thinking up clever epigrams to entertain Shade and Rose at dinner.<br>They never printed their heartless little jests, of course. Mustn&#x2019;t disillusion their readers, who saw them as omnipotent and benevolent deities meddling in the affairs of mortals. At least, Henry liked to think his readers imagined him in such an exalted position, if only for a few fleeting hours before they wrapped the potato peels in his newspaper column, or set it down on the kitchen floor for the new puppy. Sic transit gloria mundi.<br>The train clattered on, and he stared out at the barren fields edged by a forest of skeletal trees. In just such a landscape, the broken body of a child had been unearthed.<br>Now that had been a story. A golden-haired baby kidnapped . . . Father a dashing pi lot, who gained worldwide celebrity as the first man to fly nonstop across the Atlantic . . . Mother an ambassador&#x2019;s daughter . . . Frantic searches . . . Ransom demands, and then all hopes dashed when the child&#x2019;s remains were found in nearby woods in a shallow grave . . . that story had everything. Wealth, culture, celebrity, tragedy, and since it had all happened in New Jersey, a comfortable distance from Washington and New York, the reporters had been able to make excursions back to the city.<br>That had been the perfect assignment. All of them thought so. A case that transfixed the world, enough drama and glamour to sell a year&#x2019;s worth of newspapers, all set in a civilized locale convenient for the national press. And for a grand finale: the execution of the guilty man, a foreigner&#x2014;a detested German&#x2014;who had been caught with the ransom money hidden in his garage. If they had invented the tale out of whole cloth, they couldn&#x2019;t have done better.<br>In this case they wouldn&#x2019;t be so lucky. This time a backwoods coal miner had got his head bashed in, and because the culprit&#x2014;or the defendant, anyhow&#x2014;was a beautiful, educated girl, the newspaper editors thought that Mr. and Mrs. America would eat it up. Provided, of course, it was served to them in a palatable stew of sex, drama, and exotic local color. Henry Jernigan was just the chef to concoct this tasty dish.<br>He directed his gaze out the window, hoping to soothe the pain in his temples with the calming effect of the austere view: more brown, empty fields, bare hillsides of leafless trees, and beyond that the distant haze of blue mountains, indistinguishable from the lowlying clouds at the horizon.<br>In the stubbled ruin of a cornfield, he saw a ragged scarecrow swaying in the wind, which summoned to mind a favorite verse from the Japanese poet Bash?: &#x201c;A weathered skeleton in windswept fields of memory . . .&#x201d; He looked around at his fellow passengers, bundled up in drab clothes, sleeping or staring off into space. Surely he was the only person present conversant with the works of Bash?. Yes, once Henry Jernigan had possessed a soul above the cheap pratings of a tabloid newspaper, and in his cups he still could quote from memory the masters of literature from Li Po to Cervantes. But what good had it done him?<br>Scarecrows in dead land.<br>The chiaroscuro vista sweeping past him only succeeded in further quelling his spirits. Jernigan hoped he liked the countryside as much as the next man, but as a city-dweller born and bred, he preferred nature in cultivated moderation: a nice arboretum, for example. This temperate jungle spread out before him, tangled underbrush and dense forest, hedged by dark, forbidding mountains, simply reinforced his belief that he was leaving civilization. At least, he was leaving single malt scotch and the Paris-trained chefs of Manhattan&#x2019;s restaurants, which amounted to the same thing.<br>It was the fault of Mr. John Fox, Jr., that he was on this journey in the first place&#x2014;all the more reason to loathe the man&#x2019;s book. Still, he would persevere, hoping that if he kept reading, the text might provide him with a few wisps of atmosphere to spice up the story he would have to write. The book, first published in 1908 and popular again now only because of the film currently being made of it, took place in the 1890s, but surely nothing had changed around here in the ensuing four decades. Besides, where else could you turn for a primer on the backwoods culture of the Southern mountains? He needed some telling details, a few quaint folk customs, some strands of irony to elevate the sordid little tale to the level of tragedy.<br>Details were Henry Jernigan&#x2019;s specialty. Well, all of their specialties, really. Each of his colleagues-cum-rivals, all of whom were probably holed up somewhere on this interminable train, had his own forte in transforming an ordinary account of human vice and folly into an epic saga that would sell newspapers. Jernigan&#x2019;s own skill lay in framing an incident in the classical perspective, so that every jilted lover was a thwarted Romeo, every murdered wife a Desdemona. He regaled his readers with his cultural observations, making allusions to historical parallels and literary counterparts, working in a telling quote to elevate the tone of even the most sordid little murder. High-brow stuff, so that the readers could tell themselves they weren&#x2019;t wallowing in the squalor of poverty and misery; they were gaining a new perspective on the essential truths of classical literature.<br>He was lucky to work for a newspaper that could afford such literary extravagance. Some of his colleagues had to stagger along on blood and gore accounts not far removed from the True Detective pulps, and the sob sisters had to manufacture a beautiful and innocent heroine in every dung heap of a case they covered. He had heard that there were reporters who could do the job cold sober, but he wouldn&#x2019;t like to try it.<br>His gaze returned to the infernal book on his lap, The Trail of the Lonesome Pine. Absolute hokum and melodrama: Harvard engineer romances pure mountain gal against the backdrop of a feud. Its author had much to answer for. Of course, except for the geographic location, the novel was not even remotely connected to the death in question, but if Fox&#x2019;s book had not existed, Henry Jernigan would be back in New York or Washington, enjoying a leisurely dinner in convivial company, instead of hurtling through the Virginia outback along with the rest of the carrion squad.<br>Bring out your dead, he thought. The phrase was apt. It made him think, not of plague corpses on London carts, but of the influenza victims in the Philadelphia of his youth. He shuddered, and pushed away the image. He and his colleagues scavenged not on carrion, but on the hearts of the victims: the loved ones of the slain; the family of the accused; and all the peripheral little souls whose lives were besmirched by the crime of the moment.<br>He was so pleased with the erudition of this observation that he looked around the car for some fellow sufferer to share it with, but the only other colleague he recognized was his assigned photographer, Shade Baker, slouched down in a window seat, with his hat over his eyes. Pity. Epigrams would be wasted on him. Baker was a son of the Midwestern prairie, an artist of blood and bone, using his artistry to illuminate the bruises, the blood-stained bodies, and the pathetic artifacts of the crime scene.<br>Last year Shade&#x2019;s photos had illustrated the lurid stories that had waxed poetic over the battered body of little Charlie Lindbergh, unearthed from that shallow grave in the Jersey woods, so heartbreakingly close to the house from which he was taken. The Lindbergh case was the last time they had all been together.<br>Elsewhere, Luster Swann, whose gutter press tabloid made Henry shudder, was probably chatting up the most angelic-looking girl on the train, wherever she was. Swann, a gaunt bloodhound of a man, was invariably drawn to vacant-eyed blondes who looked as if they had just wandered out of the choir loft. The irony was that there was no greater misogynist than Luster Swann, who thought all women either treacherous or wanton, or occasionally both. He seemed always to hope to find some ethereal innocent who would convince him otherwise, but he never succeeded, which was just as well, because his journalistic specialty was a judicious mixture of cynicism and righteous indignation. To Swann every female defendant was a scheming Jezebel, and every weeping victim a little tramp who deserved what ever she got.<br>Jernigan scanned the car one more time, but no familiar faces gazed back at him. None of the others were around, but they might turn up later on in the dining car.<br>Oh God, he needed a drink.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;BE YOU HEADED for Knoxville?&#x201d;<br>Jernigan started out of a daze as if the book itself had spoken, but when he turned in the direction of the voice, he found that his seat-mate, the rabbity man in the rumpled brown suit, who had snored most of the way from Washington, had now awakened, bright-eyed and in a talkative mood.<br>Jernigan shook his head. &#x201c;Knoxville? No, not as far as that.&#x201d; He forced himself to respond in kind. &#x201c;How about yourself, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m going up home to Wise. Been to see my sister and her family up in the big city.&#x201d; The little man looked at him appraisingly, taking note of Jernigan&#x2019;s well-cut suit and the gold clasp on his silk rep tie. A slow grin spread across his face. &#x201c;Coal company business, then? Like as not you&#x2019;ll be headed up to Wise County, I reckon, to visit the mines.&#x201d;<br>Jernigan inclined his head. &#x201c;My business does take me to Wise County. Would you be a resident there yourself?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Born and bred,&#x201d; said the man happily. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in the mines, though, no sir. My business is timber. I hope you&#x2019;ve made arrangements for accommodations in the town already. Lodging should be at a premium this week.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In a village in the back of beyond?&#x201d; Henry&#x2019;s murmur conveyed polite skepticism. &#x201c;Why should it be crowded, especially at this bleak time of year?&#x201d;<br>The man blinked at him, astounded by this display of ignorance. &#x201c;Not crowded?&#x201d; he spluttered. &#x201c;Did you not hear about the murder trial that&#x2019;s about to start up there?&#x201d;<br>Henry Jernigan was careful to set his face into a mask of polite boredom. &#x201c;Why, no,&#x201d; he said with as much indifference as he could muster. &#x201c;A murder trial, you say? I don&#x2019;t suppose it amounts to much, but if you&#x2019;d care to pass the time, you may tell me something about it.&#x201d;<br>Had he identified himself as a reporter and attempted to question this garrulous stranger about the local scandal, no doubt the man would have clammed up and refused to utter a single word on the subject, but by implying that this singular news was of no consequence to him, he had ensured that he would be regaled with every salacious detail the fellow could muster. Odd creatures, human beings, but entirely predictable, once you had learned the patterns of behavior. He contrived to look suitably indifferent to the tale.<br>&#x201c;A man got murdered up there in Wise County back in the summer,&#x201d; his seatmate declared.<br>Jernigan stifl...</p><h2>Westmoreland Glass the Popular Years 1940-1985</h2><p>With all-new, never-before-seen photographs and catalog pages, Kovar covers many patterns in this volume, including Paneled Grape, Old Quilt, Princes Feather, Sawtooth, American Hobnail, and English Hobnail.

In observers from Lord Byron to Sigmund Freud to Virginia Woolf it met with astonishment, rapture, poetry, even tears--and, always, recognition. Twenty-five hundred years after it first rose above Athens, the Parthenon remains one of the wonders of the world, its beginnings and strange turns of fortune over millennia a perpetual source of curiosity, controversy, and intrigue. </p><p> </p><p> At once an entrancing cultural history and a congenial guide for tourists, armchair travelers, and amateur archaeologists alike, this book conducts readers through the storied past and towering presence of the most famous building in the world. Who built the Parthenon, and for what purpose? How are we to understand its sculpture? Why is it such a compelling monument? The classicist and historian Mary Beard takes us back to the fifth century B.C. to consider the Parthenon in its original guise--as the flagship temple of imperial Athens, housing an enormous gold and ivory statue of the city's patron goddess attended by an enigmatic assembly of sculptures. Just as fascinating is the monument's far longer life as cathedral church of Our Lady of Athens, as "the finest mosque in the world," and, finally, as an inspirational ruin and icon. Beard also takes a cool look at the bitter arguments that continue to surround the "Elgin Marbles," the sculptures from the Parthenon now in the British Museum. Her book constitutes the ultimate tour of the marvelous history and present state of this glory of the Acropolis, and of the world. </p></p><p>Mary Beard has a Chair of Classics at Cambridge and is a Fellow of Newnham College. She is classics editor of The Times Literary Supplement and author of the blog &#x201c;A Don&#x2019;s Life&#x201d;. She is also a winner of the 2008 Wolfson History Prize.Wry and imaginative, this gem of a book deconstructs the most famous building in Western history. Beard, probably Britain's best-known classicist, elucidates...the history of the ancient building, the functions--church, mosque, barracks, ammunition dump--it has served since antiquity, and the place it has held in the European imagination in the modern era. With �clat she dashes most of what we think we know about the ancient Greeks' building: the iconic image of the Parthenon held today is the product of a terribly inaccurate reconstruction in the 1920s, a reconstruction now being painstakingly undone...Beard reveals just how alien...the classical Greeks are to us, and just how little we know about them. (Benjamin Schwarz <i>The Atlantic</i> 2003-04-01)<br><br>With painstaking attention to detail and a fair-minded view of centuries-old controversies, Mary Beard delivers a brief, but thorough, and surprisingly readable history of what is arguably the world's most famous building...Beard pieces together what we do know, beginning with the earliest surviving account...[She] does a fine job of storytelling...describing changes on the site from a modern tourist's perspective. (Stephen H. Morgan <i>Boston Globe</i> 2003-05-04)<br><br>In her brief but compendious volume [Beard] says that the more we find out about this mysterious structure, the less we know. Her book is especially valuable because it is up to date on the restoration the Parthenon has been undergoing since 1986. (Garry Wills <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2003-10-09)<br><br><i>The Parthenon</i> is an excellent and concise guide to one of the most famous structures in the world. Mary Beard takes readers on a journey, at once historical, anthropological, and archaeological, that is both thorough and good-naturedly humorous...This book will appeal to a wide range of readers looking to learn more about the Parthenon and Greek history.

Every page offers natural ways to avoid saying or writing the vague, the long-winded, the needlessly technical, and the hopelessly stale. With verve and eloquence, Erik Wensberg spears the empty words that clog clear thought&#x2014;&#x201c;impact,&#x201d; &#x201c;frustrated,&#x201d; &#x201c;basically,&#x201d; and many more&#x2014;and offers us good English words that are definite and have more life. <br><br>Offering standards by which to judge language now and in the future, Modern American Usage takes account of a generation of changes in American idiom and of attempts to reform the use of pronouns, titles, and phrases to fit shifting ideals of social justice. All this it does with easy learning and with sympathy alike for the experienced writer and for those who come new to American English.<br></p><p>Erik Wensberg has worked as an editor at<i> Esquire </i>and <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, and has taught nonfiction writing at Columbia University.<br>Nobody has discussed these matters with greater lucidity and concision (another linguistic virtue) than Wilson Follett....

Built over the course of 75 years, from the late-19th century to the mid-20th century, these homes were each designed and built by the artists as an expression of their aesthetic sentiments, and in many cases, as extensions of their artwork. As such, these private domains are utterly unique and deeply imbued with each artist's singular vision and talent. A few of the homes have been awarded National Historic Landmark status, and several are open to the public, while still others have sadly fallen into disrepair or are now in the hands of new owners. In a few cases, the photographs in this book represent the last record of the house as created by its artist resident.<br><br>Praise for Artists' Handmade Houses:<br><br>"The house histories by Michael Gotkin are concise and illuminating; the new photography by Don Freeman, stunning."&nbsp;<br><i>-The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;<br><br></i> &#x201c;This gorgeous collection of houses handcrafted by some of America&#x2019;s finest artists is not only a must-read but a must-examine-closely.&#x201d;<p></p><br> &#x2014;<i>The Chicago Tribune</i> <br> <b><p>&nbsp;</p></b><p></p>"There's ample opportunity for both looking and learning with <i>Artists' Handmade Houses."<br>&nbsp;-ARTnews <br></i><br>"Freeman's ability to capture details . . . coupled with a good eye for scale, gives the reader a true sense of place; Gotkin's insightful text is an added delight, deepening readers' appreciation of the design that makes each home so unique."&nbsp;<br>-Publishers Weekly.com</p><p>Don Freeman's photographs appear regularly in <i>The World of Interiors, Vogue, House Beautiful</i>, and <i>Vanity Fair</i>, among others.

So wrote Conrad Aiken of Lorca&#39;s violent response to the New York he encountered as a student at Columbia University in 1929 and 1930. Born and brought up in Andalusia, Lorca&#39;s reaction to the brutality and loneliness of the vast city was one of amazement and indignation. His poetry moved away from the lyricism of the early Romanceros and became a vehicle for experimental techniques through which he expressed tortured feelings of alienation and dislocation. Based on a new edition of the original text, Greg Simon&#39;s and Steven White&#39;s new translation brings to life Lorca&#39;s arresting imagery. Christopher Maurer, a leading authority on Lorca&#39;s work, provides an enlightening introduction placing &#34;Poet in New York&#34; in context, and there are translations of Lorca&#39;s letters as well as a lecture he gave about the work. Illustrated with archive photographs, this comprehensive volume will make Lorca&#39;s masterpiece available to a whole new generation of readers.</p><p>Federico Garcia Lorca was born into an educated family of small landowners in Fuente Vaqueros in 1898. A poet, dramatist, musician and artist, he attended the university at Granada, where he acquired a fine knowledge of literature. In 1919 he went to the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid and during his long stay there he met all the principal writers, critics and scholars who visited the place, which was then a flourishing centre of cultural liberalism. In 1928 his Gipsy-Ballad Book (Romancero gitano) received much public acclaim. In 1929 he went to New York with Fernando de los Rios and his volume of poems Poet in New York (Poeta en Nueva York) was published posthumously in 1940. On his return to republican Spain, he devoted himself to the theatre, as co-director of La Barraca, a government-sponsored student theatrical company that toured the country. He now wrote fewer poems, but these include his masterpiece Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias (Llanto por la muerte de Ignacio Sanchez Mejias, 1935), a lament for a dead bullfighter. He wrote classical plays, pantomimic interludes, puppet plays, La zapatera prodigiosa (1930) and three tragedies: Blood Wedding (Bodas de sangre, 1933), Yerma (1934) and The House of Bernarda Alba (La casa de Bernarda Alba, 1936). Just after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 he was murdered at Granada by Nationalist partisans, in mysterious circumstances.Text: English, Spanish (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Golf: Steps to Success (Steps to Success Activity)</h2><p>Covers swing motion, pitch shots, chip shots, putting, sand shots, uneven lies, mental focus, shot selection, strategy, and self-evaluation</p><p>DeDe Owens, EdD, is the Director of Instruction at Cog Hill Golf Club in Lemont, Illinois and a member of the Wilson Sporting Goods staff and Golf Digest Magazine professional staff.

The first five chapters naturally developed their own characters, and it wasn&#x2019;t until I started to revisit old recipes that they began to evolve into quite distinct areas of interest. I found that the drinks shared a genealogy&#x2014;an idea was born, then pushed, then pushed further, changing slightly and then being changed again. I would look at the ingredients of a cocktail one way and then this would open up a new line of thinking&#x2014;a chain reaction&#x2014;just like my initial involvement in the cocktail industry. <br> &nbsp;<br> New cocktails are usually born from experimenting with flavor connections and listening to a gut instinct. The recipes in this book are often quite romantic in nature. Yes, they have historical references, but they go beyond that. Inspiration can come from many places, not always obviously related to cocktails, and they straddle diverse terrains&#x2014;from perfume to films, from poetry to an image of a landscape. Others were inspired by well-loved regulars at my bars&#x2014;characters worthy of a book in themselves! These stories imbue a hint of fantasy to otherwise quite technical products. I have to be very thankful for my distractions! <br> &nbsp;<br> When I said earlier that cocktails occupy a nebulous place, so too does this book. It is not a classic cocktail book, nor is it a bar manual. There are recipes here for the home enthusiast but also for the technician. Some of the recipes are known or have solid references, but here my aim is to demonstrate there can be a new point of interest or perspective&#x2014;what inspired them, how they came together, how they&#x2019;ve changed, and why they work.

The chapters reflect the importance of caring for our personal well-being, nurturing our loved ones, supporting our community, developing fair and sustainable trade and last, but not least, uniting in celebration.' (Meryl Streep <i>From The Foreword</i>)<br><br>A visually stunning cookbook with heart, I know it won't be long before it takes on the appearance all well-used cookbooks have ... a few splatters here, a smudge there. I can't wait to get started. With a foreword by Meryl Streep, contributors include Paul McCartney, Trudie Styler, Annie Lennox and Richard Branson. All profits from sales of this book will go towards Women for Women International ... so if you are looking for a cookbook, this is the one you must have! (Monique Mulligan <i>Write Note Reviews, 5/14/13</i>)<br><br>Women for Women International's beautifully photographed recipe trove spans countries and cultures (from the Democratic Republic of Congo to author Alice Walker's own kitchen) to pay homage to the meals and memories that shape dinner tables around the world. (<i>Daily Candy, May 30, 2013</i>)<br><br>This is a cookbook about celebration: celebrating women who have survived war and other conflicts, and celebrating the foods that nourish us and bring us together. With recipes like sweet, cakey Sudanese Baseema and fragrant Burmese tomato fish curry, it's also a cookbook that will lift you right up from your seat and carry you straight into the kitchen. Stories are as important and sustaining as food, and you'll find plenty of them here. Interspersed between the recipes, women tell their stories of survival and determination, and how they came to take part in the programs offered by Women for Women International. These stories often stand in stark contrast to the beautiful smiling faces and the bright plates of food on the surrounding pages, but this makes each woman's message of moving from victim to independence all the more powerful.This book is practically a Who's Who of celebrity personalities. Everyone from Alice Waters and Jamie Oliver to Paul McCartney and Nell Newman have contributed recipes. I love the incredible diversity of tastes, ingredients, and personalities this brings to the table! All of the royalties from this book go toward micro-financing and training women in food production and self-sustenance. Helping a good cause while adding a new trove of global recipes to my collection? That's a two-for-one deal I can definitely get behind. (Emma Christensen <i>The Kitchn, 6/12/13</i>)<br><br>Today's recipe is one of the 'celebration' in a remarkable new cookbook, Share. Subtitled 'The Cookbook That Celebrates Our Common Humanity,' it's a collection of recipes from all over the world, and 100 percent of the profits of the publisher&#x2014;Kyle Books&#x2014;goes to Women for Women International, which since 1993 has been helping women in war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and South Sudan. The more than 100 global recipes come from an interesting mix of people who work with the charity and other humanitarian causes. As actress Meryl Streep writes in the foreword, the 'underlying message' of the book is, 'For all our apparent diversity&#x2014;as individuals, societies and nations&#x2014;our actions, however small, have an exponential influence in the world through our shared humanity.' Other contributors of recipes, stories and inspiration include women the charity has helped, as well as a crowd of famous people such as Ms. Streep, Christiane Amanpour, Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Bill McKibben, Yotam Ottolenghi and Alice Waters. (Bill Batz Jr. <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 7/14/13</i>)<br><br>The first thing you need know is that, as a cookbook, Share is great. The food looks (and is) delicious, the ingredients are commonly available, and the instructions are well within the skill set of your average home cook. This is not a small thing, considering the wide variety of foods and recipes the book shares. The recipes were gathered not only from home cooks in the far-flung the regions where Women for Women International does its work, but also from kitchens of celebrities and philanthropists (Sir Paul McCartney, Nell Newman, Christiane Amanpour among them), and world class chefs (Alice Waters, Yotam Ottolenghi, Jesse Ziff Cool, and others). But this is not party food -- this is the food we sit down to enjoy with our friends and our families -- informal, straightforward in its preparation, and made from ingredients that come easily to hand. And that&#x2019;s the point. Just as we are nourished and strengthened by food, so do we nourish and encourage one another in spirit when we sit down to share it. This is precisely the work of Women for Women International (WfWI), a humanitarian organization that works with women in countries where war and conflict have devastated their lives and communities. WfWI programs enable these women to move from being victims, to being survivors, and ultimately active citizens. And that&#x2019;s just the beginning: for every women helped in a WfWI program, five more benefit. 100% of the profits from Share go to support the work of Women for Women International. Share the wonderful food in this book with your family; buy extra copies of the book as gifts. Step up to the plate: it&#x2019;s a good meal and a good deed all rolled into one. (Karen Yencich, Food &amp; Recipe Examiner <i>Examiner.com, 8/8/13</i>)<br><br>Share is more than a cookbook. The photos alone make me want to go into my kitchen and cook. But the stories of the women inspire me to reach out globally. You see the power of helping just one person and how it can have a positive, even joyful impact. Share is a cookbook you must share with others in your life. (Mary Orlin <i>11/12/13</i>)<br><br>Lush with photographs, this is indeed 'a book of joy,' as Meryl Streep writes in the foreword&#x2014;a wonderful collection for families to explore and cook from together. (Rebekah Denn <i>The Seattle Times, 11/18/13</i>)<br><br>Expand someone's recipe collection, and help change lives across the globe with Women for Women International's Share cookbook. The compilation features photographs and recipes from renowned international chefs and the kitchens of women living in war-torn countries. One hundred percent of the proceeds go right back into those countries, providing women with business training and job skills so they can get back on their feet. (Bobbie Thomas, Gifts that Give Back <i>The Today Show, 12/6/13</i>)<br><br>Women for Women International was founded 20 years ago to help women in eight war-torn countries rebuild their lives. The group has produced a stunning cookbook as a fund-raiser that features first-person accounts and exotic recipes from some of the women. Other recipes were contributed by chefs and others involved in humanitarian efforts like Meryl Streep, Christiane Amanpour, Desmond Tutu, Jamie Oliver and Ren� Redzepi. Some are quite complex and well spiced, while others, like Emma Thompson&#x2019;s tempting sausage and cabbage casserole, are 'ridiculously easy,' as she puts it.

His books have sold more than 7.4 million copies and have been translated into 20 languages. Renowned for up-to-the-minute content and easy-to-follow steps, all of Hart&#39;s books have become staples for a new generation of aspiring artists and professionals, and they have been selected by the American Library Association for special notice.Adult/High School&#x2013;While it won't replace a more traditional study of anatomy, this book covers the basics in good detail, always relating the discussion of bones and muscle groups to the exaggerated physiology found in comic books. The illustrations are lavish, often in full color, with black and white used for the drawings where color would obscure the lesson being imparted. A mixture of comic-book-proportioned anatomical drawings and finished art helps to show the transition between fact and presentation, with the text highlighting what has been emphasized as well as what has been left out to get the proper look. The last part of the book includes a discussion of how the comic-book business works and several interviews with artists, all of which drift from the topic of anatomy somewhat but is still useful and interesting. Attractively presented and educational, this title will be popular with comic-book fans who like to draw.<i>&#x2013;Paul Brink, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Once an infidel and<br>libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, he wrote for his own epitaph,<br> by the rich mercy of Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned, and<br>appointed to preach the faith he had long laboured to destroy .<br>It was through his correspondence that Newton fulfilled his distinctive<br>work as the letter writer par excellence of the Evangelical Revival . His grasp of Scripture and deep personal experience, his many friends (among them, George Whitefield, William Cowper and William Wilberforce), his manifold trials, his country pastorate, his strong, clear, idiomatic style all these factors combined to prepare the author of How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds , for the exercise of his special gift. These practical letters cover a wide variety of subjects and aim to conform the believer to Christ .</p><p></p><h2>Extraordinary, Ordinary People: A Memoir of Family</h2><p><p><b>This is the story of Condoleezza Rice that has never been told, not that of an ultra-accomplished world leader, but of a little girl--and a young woman--trying to find her place in a sometimes hostile world, of two exceptional parents, and an extended family and community that made all the difference.</b></p><p>Condoleezza Rice has excelled as a diplomat, political scientist, and concert pianist. Her achievements run the gamut from helping to oversee the collapse of communism in Europe and the decline of the Soviet Union, to working to protect the country in the aftermath of 9-11, to becoming only the second woman--and the first black woman ever--to serve as Secretary of State. <br>&nbsp;<br>But until she was 25 she never learned to swim, because when she was a little girl in Birmingham, Alabama, Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor decided he'd rather shut down the city's pools than give black citizens access.<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout the 1950's, Birmingham's black middle class largely succeeded in insulating their children from the most corrosive effects of racism, providing multiple support systems to ensure the next generation would live better than the last. But by 1963, Birmingham had become an environment where blacks were expected to keep their head down and do what they were told--or face violent consequences. That spring two bombs exploded in Rice&#x2019;s neighborhood amid a series of chilling Klu Klux Klan attacks.&nbsp; Months later, four young girls lost their lives in a particularly vicious bombing.<br>&nbsp;<br>So how was Rice able to achieve what she ultimately did?<br>&nbsp;<br>Her father, John, a minister and educator, instilled a love of sports and politics. Her mother, a teacher, developed Condoleezza&#x2019;s passion for piano and exposed her to the fine arts. From both, Rice learned the value of faith in the face of hardship and the importance of giving back to the community. Her parents&#x2019; fierce unwillingness to set limits propelled her to the venerable halls of Stanford University, where she quickly rose through the ranks to become the university&#x2019;s second-in-command. An expert in Soviet and Eastern European Affairs, she played a leading role in U.S. policy as the Iron Curtain fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated. Less than a decade later, at the apex of the hotly contested 2000 presidential election, she received the exciting news--just shortly before her father&#x2019;s death--that she would go on to the White House as the first female National Security Advisor.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>As comfortable describing lighthearted family moments as she is recalling the poignancy of her mother&#x2019;s cancer battle and the heady challenge of going toe-to-toe with Soviet leaders, Rice holds nothing back in this remarkably candid telling.</p></p><p><p>CONDOLEEZZA RICE was the 66th United States Secretary of State and the first black woman to ever hold that office.&nbsp; Prior to that, she was the first woman to serve as National Security Advisor.&nbsp; She currently teaches at Stanford University.</p>Chapter One <br><br>Starting Early My parents were anxious to give me a head start in life&#x2014;perhaps a little too anxious. My first memory of confronting them and in a way declaring my independence was a conversation concerning their ill-conceived attempt to send me to first grade at the ripe age of three. My mother was teaching at Fairfield Industrial High School in Alabama, and the idea was to enroll me in the elementary school located on the same campus. I don&#x2019;t know how they talked the principal into going along, but sure enough, on the first day of school in September 1958, my mother took me by the hand and walked me into Mrs. Jones&#x2019; classroom.<br><br>I was terrified of the other children and of Mrs. Jones, and I refused to stay. Each day we would repeat the scene, and each day my father would have to pick me up and take me to my grandmother&#x2019;s house, where I would stay until the school day ended. Finally I told my mother that I didn&#x2019;t want to go back because the teacher wore the same skirt every morning. I am sure this was not literally true. Perhaps I somehow already understood that my mother believed in good grooming and appropriate attire. Anyway, the logic of my argument aside, Mother and Daddy got the point and abandoned their attempt at really early childhood education.<br><br>I now think back on that time and laugh. John and Angelena were prepared to try just about anything&#x2014;or to let me try just about anything&#x2014;that could be called an educational opportunity. They were convinced that education was a kind of armor shielding me against everything&#x2014;even the deep racism in Birmingham and across America.<br><br>They were bred to those views. They were both born in the South at the height of segregation and racial prejudice&#x2014;Mother just outside of Birmingham, Alabama, in 1924 and Daddy in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1923. They were teenagers during the Great Depression, old enough to remember but too young to adopt the overly cautious financial habits of their parents. They were of the first generation of middle-class blacks to attend historically black colleges&#x2014;institutions that previously had been for the children of the black elite. And like so many of their peers, they rigorously controlled their environment to preserve their dignity and their pride. <br><br>Objectively, white people had all the power and blacks had none. &#x201c;The White Man,&#x201d; as my parents called &#x201c;them,&#x201d; controlled politics and the economy. This depersonalized collective noun spoke to the fact that my parents and their friends had few inter-actions with whites that were truly personal. In his wonderful book Colored People, Harvard professor Henry Louis &#x201c;Skip&#x201d; Gates Jr. recalled that his family and friends in West Virginia addressed white people by their professions&#x2014;for example, &#x201c;Mr. Policeman&#x201d; or &#x201c;Mr. Milkman.&#x201d; Black folks in Birmingham didn&#x2019;t even have that much contact. It was just &#x201c;The White Man.&#x201d; <br><br>Certainly, in any confrontation with a white person in Alabama you were bound to lose. But my parents believed that you could alter that equation through education, hard work, perfectly spoken English, and an appreciation for the &#x201c;finer things&#x201d; in &#x201c;their&#x201d; culture. If you were twice as good as they were, &#x201c;they&#x201d; might not like you but &#x201c;they&#x201d; had to respect you. One could find space for a fulfilling and productive life. There was nothing worse than being a helpless victim of your circumstances. My parents were determined to avoid that station in life. Needless to say, they were even more determined that I not end up that way.<br><br>My parents were not blue bloods. Yes, there were blue bloods who were black. These were the families that had emerged during Reconstruction, many of whose patriarchs had been freed well before slavery ended. Those families had bloodlines going back to black lawyers and doctors of the late nineteenth century; some of their ancestral lines even included political figures such as Hiram Rhodes Revels, the first black United States senator. There were pockets of these families in the Northeast and a large colony in Chicago. Some had attended Ivy League schools, but others, particularly those from the South, sent their children to such respected institutions as Meharry Medical College, Fisk, Morehouse, Spelman, and the Tuskegee Institute. In some cases these families had been college-educated for several generations.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s family was not from this caste, though it was more patrician than my father&#x2019;s. Mattie Lula Parrom, my maternal grandmother, was the daughter of a high-ranking official, perhaps a bishop, in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Though details about her father, my great-grandfather, are sketchy, he was able to provide my grandmother with a first-rate education for a &#x201c;colored&#x201d; girl of that time. She was sent to a kind of finishing school called St. Mark&#x2019;s Academy and was taught to play the piano by a European man who had come from -Vienna. Grandmother had rich brown skin and very high cheekbones, exposing American Indian blood that was obvious, if ill-defined. She was deeply religious, unfailingly trusting in God, and cultured.<br><br>My grandfather Albert Robinson Ray III was one of six siblings, extremely fair-skinned and possibly the product of a white father and black mother. His sister Nancy had light eyes and auburn hair. There was also apparently an Italian branch of the family on his mother&#x2019;s side, memorialized in the names of successive generations. There are several Altos; my mother and her grandmother were named Angelena; my aunt was named Genoa (though, as southerners, we call her &#x201c;Gen-OH-a&#x201d;); my cousin is Lativia; and I am Condoleezza, all attesting to that part of our heritage. <br><br>Granddaddy Ray&#x2019;s story is a bit difficult to tie down because he ran away from home when he was thirteen and did not reconnect with his family until he was an adult. According to family lore, Granddaddy used a tire iron to beat a white man who had assaulted his sister. Fearing for his life, he ran away and, later, found himself sitting in a train station with one token in his pocket in the wee hours of the morning. Many years later, Granddaddy would say that the sound of a train made him feel lonely. His last words before he died were to my mother. &#x201c;Angelena,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re on this train alone.&#x201d;<br><br>In any case, as Granddaddy sat alone in that station, a white man came over and asked what he was doing there at that hour of the night. For reasons that are not entirely clear, &#x201c;Old Man Wheeler,&#x201d; as he was known in our family, took my grandfather home and raised him with his sons. I remember very well going to my grandmother&#x2019;s house in 1965 to tell her that Granddaddy had passed away at the hospital. She wailed and soon said, &#x201c;Somebody call the Wheeler boys.&#x201d; One came over to the house immediately. They were obviously just like family.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always been struck by this story because it speaks to the complicated history of blacks and whites in America. We came to this country as founding populations&#x2014;Europeans and Africans. Our bloodlines have crossed and been intertwined by the ugly, sexual exploitation that was very much a part of slavery. Even in the depths of segregation, blacks and whites lived very close to one another. There are the familiar stories of black nannies who were &#x201c;a part of the family,&#x201d; raising the wealthy white children for whom they cared. But there are also inexplicable stories like that of my grandfather and the Wheelers. <br><br>We still have a lot of trouble with the truth of how tangled our family histories are. These legacies are painful and remind us of America&#x2019;s birth defect: slavery. I remember all the fuss about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings a few years back. Are we kidding? I thought. Of course Jefferson had black children. I can also remember being asked how I felt when I learned that I apparently had two white great-grandfathers, one on each side of the family. I just considered it a fact&#x2014;no feelings were necessary. We all have white ancestors, and some whites have black ancestors. Once at a Stanford football game, my father and I sat in front of a white man who reached out his hand and said, &#x201c;My name is Rice too. And I&#x2019;m from the South.&#x201d; The man blanched when my father suggested we might be related. <br><br>It is just easier not to talk about all of this or to obscure it with the term &#x201c;African American,&#x201d; which recalls the immigration narrative. There are groups such as Mexican Americans, Korean Americans, and German Americans who retain a direct link to their immigrant ancestors. But the fact is that only a portion of those with black skin are direct descendants of African immigrants as is President Obama, who was born of a white American mother and a Kenyan father. There is a second narrative, which involves immigrants from the West Indies such as Colin Powell&#x2019;s parents. And what of the descendants of slaves in the old Confederacy? I prefer &#x201c;black&#x201d; and &#x201c;white.&#x201d; These terms are starker and remind us that the first Europeans and the first Africans came to this country together&#x2014;the Africans in chains.</p><h2>Passages Through Recovery: An Action Plan for Preventing Relapse</h2><p>Passages through Recovery presents an action plan for preventing relapse, one that can help us understand how recovery works and what is needed to move from active addiction to sobriety.<br><br>"Abstinence from alcohol and other drugs is only the beginning of sobriety. It's the ticket to get into the theater, not the movie we are going to see."--Passages through RecoveryOne of the most important things we learn in recovery is that there really is a way out of all the misery--if we know which way to go. But abstinence from alcohol and other drugs is just the beginning of our journey, not our destination. And, that journey can be a rough one if we don't know what lies ahead.Based on the experiences of thousands of recovering men and women, Passages through Recovery presents an action plan for preventing relapse, one that can help us understand how recovery works and what is needed to move from active addiction to sobriety. Gorski's pioneering work describes six stages of recovery from chemical dependency and offers sound advice for working through the challenges of each stage--challenges that can create frustration and lead to relapse.Passages through Recovery clearly demonstrates that sobriety is more than just healing the damage. "It's a way of thinking, acting, and relating to others," Gorski writes, "that promotes continued physical, psychological, social, and spiritual health. The skills necessary for long-term sobriety are all directed at finding meaning and purpose in life."Use this book as a compass in your recovery to help you stay on course.</p><p>Terence Gorski, MA, CAC, is a nationally recognized lecturer, an acknowledged leader in the chemical dependency and codependency fields, and a workshop facilitator specializing in relapse prevention, intimacy in recovery, and treating chemically dependent adult children of alcoholics.

Confronted with a hostile colonial government and Native Americans wary of conversion, the newly-appointed bishop-elect of Mexico wrote to tell the King of Spain that, unless there was a miracle, the continent would be lost. Between December 9 and December 12, 1531, that miracle happened, and it forever changed the future of the continent.<br><br>It was then that the Virgin Mary famously appeared to a Native American Christian convert on a hilltop outside of what is now Mexico City. The image she left imprinted on his cloak or tilma has puzzled scientists for centuries, and yet Our Lady of Gudalupe&#x2019;s place in history is profound. A continent that just months before the apparitions seemed completely lost to Christianity suddenly and inexplicably embraced it by the millions. Our Lady of Guadalupe's message of love replaced the institutionalized violence of the Aztec culture, and built a bridge between two worlds &#x2014; the old and the new &#x2014; that were just ten years earlier engaged in brutal warfare.<br><br>Today, Our Lady of Guadalupe continues to inspire the devotion of millions.<br>From Canada to Argentina &#x2014; and even beyond the Americas &#x2014; one finds great devotion to her, and great appreciation for her message of love, unity and hope. Today reproductions of the Virgin&#x2019;s miraculous image can be seen throughout North and South America, in churches and homes, on billboards and even clothing apparel. Her shrine in Mexico City, where the miraculous image is housed to this day, is one of the most visited in the world.<br><br>In <i>Our Lady of Guadalupe: Mother of the Civilization of Love,</i> Anderson &amp; Chavez trace the history of Our Lady of Guadalupe from the sixteenth century to the present discuss of how her message was and continues to be an important catalyst for religious and cultural transformation. Looking at Our Lady of Guadalupe as a model of the Church and Juan Diego as a model for all Christians who seek to answer Christ's call of conversion and witness, the authors explore the changing face of the Catholic Church in North, Central, and South America, and they show how Our Lady of Guadalupe's message was not only historically significant, but how it speaks to contemporary issues confronting the American continents and people today.</p><p>CARL ANDERSON, New York Times bestselling author, is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the Knights of Columbus. He held various positions of the Executive Office of the President from 1983 to 1987, was a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and has taught at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family.<br>FATHER EDUARDO CHAVEZ is one of the most renowned experts on the Guadalupe apparitions and the postulator of St. Juan Diego&#x2019;s cause for sainthood. He is the first Dean of the Catholic University Lumen Gentium of the Archdiocese of Mexico, co-founder and Dean of the Higher Institute for Guadalupan Studies and honorary Canon of the Guadalupe Basilica.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Introduction <br><br>M<i>other of the </i>C<i>ivilization of </i>L<i>ove <br></i><br>TWO NEW EVANGELISTS <br><br>The genesis of this book occurred on July 31, 2002, the day Pope John Paul II canonized Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. We were both present that day in the basilica, but we had not yet met. One of us was par�ticipating in the liturgical event that he had worked to achieve for more than a decade as postulator of the Cause for Canonization of Juan Diego. The other had traveled to the basilica eighteen months earlier for his installation Mass as the head of the world&#x2019;s largest organization of Catholic laymen, the Knights of Columbus. Both of us were deeply touched by our experience that day in Mexico City, and both of us realized we had witnessed one of the most profound events in the Catholic Church during John Paul II&#x2019;s pontificate and indeed during our own lifetimes, an event that would give deep and lasting hope to the Catholic Church in North America. <br><br>This may strike many as an extraordinary claim; after all, John Paul II is now regarded universally as one of the greatest popes in the two�thousand�year history of the Catholic Church. As pope, he canonized and beatified hundreds of people, wrote numerous encyclicals on theological, moral, and social topics, and commis�sioned the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, the first definitive work of its kind in more than four hundred years. He brought interreli�gious dialogue to new and unexpected levels while guiding the Church into the new millennium with the focus of hope in Christ. <br><br>Beyond the Church, he changed the political map of Europe and the very course of history by helping to liberate nations trapped behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War and aiding in their cause for self�determination within the Soviet Union. Beyond Europe&#x2019;s bor�ders, his concerns for the poor, the disadvantaged, and the war�torn brought a greater commitment to human rights and democracy, especially to Latin America and Africa. But in Mexico that day, as he knelt and prayed awhile before the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe after the ceremony, it was clear that he did not want to leave; when he rose to leave, he entrusted all people to the interces�sion of the newest saint in the Church. He had not only canonized a man of the past but also given our continent a saint for the future. <br><br>Yet, early in John Paul&#x2019;s pontificate, Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico was an important, perhaps even indispensable, presence. In an interesting way, John Paul II&#x2019;s first invitation to the basilica was not intended for him; the Latin American Bishops Conference had extended the invitation to his predecessor the month before, and it was only his predecessor&#x2019;s death that opened this opportu�nity to John Paul II.1 In a telling way, it was John Paul II&#x2019;s deter�mined desire to pray at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe and to personally engage in the meetings regarding the future of the Church in America that caused him to accept the invitation his predecessor had declined. (Twenty�three years later, Mexico would see this same determination; shortly before his trip for Juan Diego&#x2019;s canonization, John Paul II met with his medical special�ists, who advised against his making the trip. But at the end of the consultation, John Paul II thanked them for their concern and concluded the meeting by saying: &#x201c;I will see you in Mexico.&#x201d;) Later, John Paul II would reflect on his first visit to Mexico, recall�ing that &#x201c;to some degree, this pilgrimage inspired and shaped all of the succeeding years of my pontificate.&#x201d;2 <br><br>If John Paul&#x2019;s pilgrimage to Mexico shaped the rest of his life as the universal pastor of the Church, his choice to visit Mexico first and his words commending Juan Diego as an evangelist expressed a new importance and new understanding of the Church in the Americas.3 He recognized the Americas as a hemisphere with a unique, rich Catholic history, and thus as a hemisphere with a unique, rich place in the future of the Church, a hemisphere with great ability to respond to and benefit from a renewed living out of the Gospel of love seen in the witness of the saints. It was in this context that a few months later, the cause for Juan Diego&#x2019;s canonization was officially opened and the Church in the Americas was reexamined and given a new focus: the new evangelization. <br><br>NEW SAINT, RENEWED DEVOTION <br><br>The story of St. Juan Diego is, of course, the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The event of his canonization cannot be understood apart from the events of her appearance. As with any apparition claim, every detail of the Guadalupan accounts must be examined: each word spoken, each miraculous or extraordinary event that deviates from the everyday, the sequence of events, the character of the people involved, their reactions to the event, their lives afterward, and espe�cially any lingering miraculous effect. For this, we begin with Antonio Valeriano&#x2019;s Nica<i>n </i>Mopohua, an account of the Guadalupan apparitions in 1531, the earliest extant edition of which is currently housed in the New York Public Library.4 The historical record sug�gests that Valeriano may have derived the information in the Nica<i>n </i>Mopohu<i>a </i>directly from Juan Diego himself, writing it down some�time before Juan Diego&#x2019;s death in 1548 and within two decades of the apparition. Besides this significant work, numerous historical records recall in varying degrees of detail the Guadalupan appari�tions, the miraculous image, the church on Tepeyac hill, and Juan Diego&#x2019;s own life; some of the most substantial works include the Nica<i>n </i>Motecpana, the Informaci�<i>n </i>d<i>e </i>1556<i>, </i>and the Informacione<i>s </i>Jur�dica<i>s </i>d<i>e </i>1666. Other items composing the complex record of the Guadalupan event include written accounts, artwork, recorded oral testimonies, investigations, wills, and other works. <br><br>Because Juan Diego would be the first Mexican indigenous saint of that time and place, the canonization process demanded extensive research, requiring a grasp of both the history of colo�nization in New Spain and pre�Colonial culture and religion. Contemporary scholars, historians, and anthropologists specializ�ing in the culture and history of Mexico&#x2019;s Indian people were con�sulted, and nearly four thousand documents related to Our Lady of Guadalupe were reviewed. Ultimately, the knowledge and insights from such research have revealed the profound relevance and symbolic richness of the apparitions and the miraculous image on Juan Diego&#x2019;s <i>tilma </i>(a cloak�like garment), showing how the Guadalupan event conveys in the language and culture of the Indians a message of hope and love. <br><br>While the facts regarding Colonial Mexico cannot be changed, the perspective advocated by historians and even the public at large has changed. Unlike many scholars of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, contemporary biographers and histori�ans often highlight the Spanish conquest and occupation of Mexico as a volatile period of spiritual repression, conflict, and violence. By bringing to light the complexity of this period, con�temporary research has played an enormous role in helping us to better comprehend&#x2014;and even test the veracity of&#x2014;the Guadalupan apparitions. But unfortunately, while the idea of &#x201c;conversion by the sword&#x201d; is now familiar, some people may view the Guadalupan apparition and devotions as a mere by�product of colonization: as a strategic devotion fabricated by missionaries seeking to convert or pacify the Indians with a Christian�Aztec story, or as a subversive devotion adopted by Indians who were confused or sought to preserve elements of Aztec religion with a fa�ade of Christianity. <br><br>Undoubtedly, the Guadalupan devotions were a cause of concern and confusion at some times, but for us this should not be surprising, considering how even today, in the Information Age, we often encounter mixed reports even on less extraordinary events. While in this book we wish to do more than judge and debate about the Catholicity of Guadalupan devotees, nevertheless it is perhaps necessary to address some generalizations about the devotion that often sidetrack readers from the religious significance of the apparition&#x2019;s expression of the Gospel. <br><br>First, to write off the rise of Guadalupan devotion to manipu�lation and misunderstanding is not only simplistic but also histor�ically incongruous regarding a politically and religiously complex situation. Among the missionaries, there was no unified front encouraging the apparitions, as many missionaries doubted and even tried to suppress the Indians&#x2019; new devotion to the Guadalupan Virgin.5 Furthermore, while the missionaries desired conversions, their distrust of the Indians&#x2019; Catholicity verged on the scrupulous, even by modern standards; these same missionar�ies, some of whom were sophisticated letrado<i>s </i>(theologians) in Spain, were known to hold off giving Indians the sacraments and to eliminate symbolic elements of sacraments that were too simi�lar to Aztec rites solely in order to keep the distinctiveness of the Christian faith obvious.6 That is, although oversight may have occurred, purposeful theological contamination, deception, and obfuscation were largely out of character. Additionally, there was a whole range of converts among the Indians, including many who completely forsook their indigenous religious practices&#x2014;but not culture&#x2014;for a Christian way of life. What is more, their life as Christians went beyond practices or rites of belonging, such as baptism, to include catechesis. <br><br>Likewise, the rise of Guadalupan devotion cannot be explained as a devotion taken up to appease Christianizing government authorities; after all, at the time of the apparition, many of the Spanish authorities in Mexico were themselves incurring excom�munication, caring less for Christian life and evangelization than for their greed�ridden pursuit of political gains.7 The fact is, while the <i>people </i>in Mexico were involved in both political and religious changes, the <i>Guadalupan devotion </i>was not used politically until the devotion arrived in Spain, when an admiral in the royal Spanish fleet took up the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the battle of Lepanto and attributed the subsequent victory to her intercession. Moreover, even though in later Mexican history the image and devotion were appropriated to serve various political and econom�ic causes (notably during the 1810 War of Independence), the original meaning and message of Our Lady of Guadalupe tran�scends the flaws and purposes of those who have turned to her. <br><br>For some, Juan Diego may seem yet another individual &#x201c;divinized&#x201d; in answer to the universal human desire for heroes to look up to. This, too, reflects another trend of demythologizing the very men once lauded as great heroes. In this light, what is striking is how Juan Diego&#x2019;s role in the apparition&#x2014;even as passed down in testimonies&#x2014;is already rather humble. While he was called to a significant and meaningful task, he was not called to a &#x201c;great&#x201d; task by any measure of earthly grandeur. His role in the apparition itself&#x2014;his first and greatest claim to renown&#x2014;was not a call to conquer lands but a simple invitation to intercede on behalf of one person by communicating a request to another. In essence, it was to vouch for and trust in another person. This sim�ple act is the kernel of meaning and truth that is served, and not obscured, by the grandeur of the divine visitations, the healings, and the miraculous tilma. It was by answering this simple invita�tion that Juan Diego set himself apart; his was a gesture of humil�ity, communication, advocacy, and trust, a gesture that we perform in less miraculous ways and situations every day of our lives. It is one of the most fundamental gestures of our humanity and the foundation of any society that wishes to live beyond selfish utili�tarianism. <br><br>THE NEWNESS OF GUADALUPE <br><br>Consequently, although we believe the appearance of Our Lady of Guadalupe to be a historical fact, we do not think that it should be consigned only to the pages of history books. In fact, in a unique way, the full radicalness of Our Lady of Guadalupe&#x2019;s apparition can only be understood fully now, when Catholicism&#x2019;s most expressed model for society is a Civilization of Love and its greatest explication of human dignity is the Theology of the Body. For at the time, the violence institutionalized in Aztec religion was not the only place where harsh practices could be found: the European justice system employed in Colonial Mexico and many of the &#x201c;standards&#x201d; of holiness among Catholics often included severe punishments and harsh penitential practices that still make us uneasy, even if the practices were less violent and more theolog�ically different from the Aztec human sacrifices. What is notable is that this harshness is not corroborated in the words of the Virgin. In fact, while other Marian apparitions (such as those at Fatima and Lourdes) included words of admonishment or even warnings, Our Lady of Guadalupe&#x2019;s only words of spiritual guid�ance are her gentle but persistent reminders to Juan Diego about love: a love that can be trusted, a love that gives dignity, a love that is personal. If we are to see in her words an answer to a spiri�tual problem, the spiritual problem it answers is a lack of love and a lack of understanding about love as relationship rather than as practice. The Guadalupan message is, in its originality, a spiritual education, an education in love. <br><br>Today, as life is often characterized by a lack of love and by misunderstandings and misgivings about love, her message is one to take to heart. For this reason, like John Paul II, we think that one of the greatest influences of Our Lady of Guadalupe upon the history of the Western Hemisphere may still be before us. In the sixteenth century, Our Lady of Guadalupe became an expression of hope and unity for millions throughout the Americas. We are con�vinced that Our Lady of Guadalupe&#x2019;s message is <i>today </i>capable of being not only an expression but a true catalyst of hope and unity for millions more throughout North America and the world. <br><br>In the Christian sense, this hope and unity are spread through evangelization&#x2014;that is, through helping one another to find in Jesus Christ the &#x201c;adequate dimension&#x201d; of our own life.8 A clear picture of how Christians in this hemisphere can approach this task spiritually can be seen in the triptych that Benedict XVI pre�sented in Aparecida, Brazil, on his first apostolic journey to the Western Hemisphere, depicting St. Juan Diego &#x201c;evangelizing with the Image of the Virgin Mary on his mantle and with the Bible in his hand&#x201d; and inscribed below with the phrase &#x201c;You shall be my witnesses.&#x201d;9 To evangelize in the future is to evangelize from and through these first witnesses of Christianity. <br><br>Historically in our continent, Mexico was not the only coun�try to be changed by this Marian evangelization. As later mission�aries left Mexico for the neighboring countries in the hemisphere, including to the lands of the future United States, their evange�lization was defined by their devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe.

Failure to Learn also analyses the similarities between this event and the Longford Gas Plant explosion in Victoria in 1998, featured in his earlier book Lessons from Longford. Professor Andrew Hopkins is being recognized by the European Process Safety Centre in October 2008, in recognition of his contribution to safety. Professor Hopkins is the first winner to receive the award, outside of Europe, which is a demonstration of the impact of his valuable work worldwide. Andrew has been awarded a prize by the European Process Safety Centre for &#34;extraordinary contribution to process safety&#34;, the first time this has been awarded outside of Europe. He also appears in the US Chemical Safety Board film on Texas City and has been invited to appear in a subsequent film. Professor Hopkins poses questions such as: Why was the number of victims so large? Who was blamed for the explosion? What were the real causes? Had lessons been learnt from the earlier incident at Longford? Has anything changed as a result of the Texas City accident? The foreword for the book was written by Carolyn Merritt, chair of the CSB at the time of the accident and subsequent inquiry.</p><p></p><h2>Leadership Jazz - Revised Edition: The Essential Elements of a Great Leader</h2><p><p>Since it was first published to wide acclaim in 1992, the bestselling <i>Leadership Jazz</i> has firmly placed itself among the great business classics. Former President Bill Clinton called it &#x201c;astonishing,&#x201d; and the late Peter Drucker advised, &#x201c;Read this slowly. This book is wisdom in action.&#x201d; <br><br>Now updated for first time in well over a decade, this powerful book reveals why today, more than ever, leadership is more an art than a science. Today&#x2019;s best leaders, De Pree says, are attuned to the needs and ideas of their followers, and even step aside at times to be followers themselves. Filled with insightful stories from De Pree&#x2019;s experience as the chairman of Herman Miller and from people he&#x2019;s met along the way, <i>Leadership Jazz</i> reveals how to: <br><br>� Hold people accountable and give them space to reach their potential<br>� See the needs of employees and those of the company as the same<br>� Inspire change and innovation <br>� Work effectively with creative people<br><br>Complete with an extensive new introduction from De Pree on why his philosophy is more relevant now than ever before, <i>Leadership Jazz</i> gives you an entirely new way to look at the difficult job of leader.</p></p><p>MAX DePREE is the author of <i>Leadership Is an Art</i>. He was CEO and chairman of the board of directors of Herman Miller Inc., and was recently elected by <i>Fortune</i> to the National Business Hall of Fame.Prologue &nbsp; <br><br>Esther, my wife, and I have a granddaughter named Zoe, the Greek word for "life." She was born prematurely and weighed one pound, seven ounces, so small that my wedding ring could slide up her arm to her shoulder. The neonatologist who first examined her told us that she had a 5 to 10 percent chance of living three days. When Esther and I scrubbed up for our first visit and saw Zoe in her isolette in the neonatal intensive care unit, she had two IVs in her navel, one in her foot, a monitor on each side of her chest, and a respirator tube and a feeding tube in her mouth. &nbsp; <br><br>To complicate matters, Zoe's biological father had jumped ship the month before Zoe was born. Realizing this, a wise and caring nurse named Ruth gave me my instructions. "For the next several months, at least, you're the surrogate father. I want you to come to the hospital every day to visit Zoe, and when you come, I would like you to rub her body and her legs and arms with the tip of your finger. While you're caressing her, you should tell her over and over how much you love her, because she has to be able to connect your voice to your touch." &nbsp; <br><br>Ruth was doing exactly the right thing on Zoe's behalf (and, of course, on my behalf as well), and without realizing it she was giving me one of the best possible descriptions of the work of a leader. At the core of becoming a leader is the need always to connect one's voice and one's touch. finding one's voice Ruth was right. Zoe, now a flourishing four-?year-?old, and I have a very special relationship. These days, her voice and touch are as important to me as my voice and touch were to her four years ago. This interdependent relationship, it seems to me, is one of the results of trying to be a good leader, of composing voice and touch. There is, of course, a prior task-finding one's voice in the first place. &nbsp; <br><br>One of the ways I have found my own voice over the years is to write. So here is another book, Leadership Jazz. I truly hope that it will help you think about the work of leaders, that it will help you in some modest way discover some of the essential elements of leadership. Perhaps more than anything, I hope that together we can ponder the mysterious energy lying impounded in the connection between voice and touch. After all, a leader's voice is the expression of one's beliefs, and the first four chapters especially deal with what we believe. A leader's touch demonstrates competence and resolve, two qualities we can discuss in the rest of the book. &nbsp; <br><br>Whether leaders articulate a personal philosophy or not, their behavior surely expresses a personal set of values and beliefs. This holds true for people in businesses and hospitals and colleges and families. The way we build and hold our relationships, the physical settings we produce, the products and services our organizations provide, the way in which we communicate-all of these things reveal who we are. Such is also the case with organizations. General Motors and Exxon have genealogies, personalities, and reputations just as surely as you and I. &nbsp; <br><br>Leadership can never stop at words. Leaders must act, and they do so only in the context of their beliefs. Without action or principles, no one can become a leader. This conviction is woven like a red thread through the following chapters. &nbsp; <br><br>A great many people in positions of leadership are not waiting around for national or international leaders or for Fortune 100 CEOs-or for me-to tell them what to do. They realize that the work of leadership belongs to the thousands of college presidents, hospital board members, people in state and local government, parents and teachers, and people in business organizations large and small. They have already embroiled themselves in the good work of being and becoming leaders. They are eager to equip themselves to do their jobs better. &nbsp; <br><br>Leadership is, as you know, not a position but a job. It's hard and exciting and good work. It's also a serious meddling in other people's lives. One examines leadership beginning not with techniques but rather with premises, not with tools but with beliefs, and not with systems but with understandings. This I truly believe. &nbsp; <br><br>On a recent trip to England, I looked out of the window just before sunrise as the plane circled over central London on its way to Heathrow. The gauze of a light fog diffused the yellow lights of the city and created a brief but exciting feeling of a new Narnia. I was looking at something I had seen many times before through a new lens. &nbsp; <br><br>Leaders need an ability to look through a variety of lenses. We need to look through the lens of a follower. We need to look through the lens of a new reality. We need to look through the lens of hard experience and failure. We need to look through the lens of unfairness and mortality. We need to look hard at our future. &nbsp; <br><br>What will be needed by the next generations, our own children and grandchildren? When will we stop being boxed in by national boundaries and cultural stereotypes? What does it mean to modulate individual rights with the common good? Are we ready to make a commitment to civility and inclusiveness? Are we ready to think seriously about a fairer way to distribute economic results among all people? Where will we find new metaphors for these essential ideas? &nbsp; <br><br>I enjoy jazz, and one way to think about leadership is to consider a jazz band. Jazz-?band leaders must choose the music, find the right musicians, and perform-in public. But the effect of the performance depends on so many things-the environment, the volunteers playing in the band, the need for everybody to perform as individuals and as a group, the absolute dependence of the leader on the members of the band, the need of the leader for the followers to play well. What a summary of an organization! &nbsp; <br><br>A jazz band is an expression of servant leadership. The leader of a jazz band has the beautiful opportunity to draw the best out of the other musicians. We have much to learn from jazz-band leaders, for jazz, like leadership, combines the unpredictability of the future with the gifts of individuals. &nbsp; <br><br>Leaders certainly need to know where they stand. But how do leaders stand? A sound philosophy isn't enough; we all need to connect voice and touch. So much discussion these days talks of ethics as a legal line in the sand, a prohibition against certain actions. But leadership is constructive, the right actions taken in the context of clear and well-?considered thinking. The active pursuit of a common good gives us the right to ask leaders and managers of all kinds to be not only successful, but faithful. While measuring success in our society seems to be hardly mysterious enough, judging faithfulness is another matter. After all, a philosophy of leadership or management cannot be caught like a cold. &nbsp; <br><br>In an effort to be helpful, let me suggest five criteria as a way to start thinking about faithfulness. &nbsp; Integrity in all things precedes all else. The open demonstration of integrity is essential; followers must be wholeheartedly convinced of their leaders' integrity. For leaders, who live a public life, perceptions become a fact of life. Leaders understand the profound difference between gestures and commitment. It's just impossible to be a closet leader. &nbsp; The servanthood of leadership needs to be felt, understood, believed, and practiced if we're to be faithful. The best description of this kind of leadership is found in the book of Luke: "The greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules, like the one who serves." The finest instruction in how to practice it can be found in Servant Leadership by Robert Greenleaf, a lovely grace note to the melody in Luke. &nbsp; <br><br>Accountability for others, especially those on the edges of life and not yet experienced in the ways of the world, is one of the great directions leaders receive from the prophet Amos. Amos tells us that leaders should encourage and sustain those on the bottom rung first and then turn to those on the top. Should we call this the trickle-?up theory? &nbsp; There is a great misconception in organizations: that a manager must be either in control or not in control. The legitimate alternative is the practice of equity. This is surely a reasonable component in anyone's philosophy of management. While equity should certainly guide the apportioning of resources, it is far more important in our human relationships. (See "A Key Called Promise" for more about equity.) &nbsp; <br><br>The last criterion for faithfulness (in this list, that is; of course you will think of more) is that leaders have to be vulnerable, have to offer others the opportunity to do their best. Leaders become vulnerable by sharing with others the marvelous gift of being personally accountable. People in a capitalist system become vulnerable by creating a genuine opportunity for others to reach their potential at the same time that all work together toward corporate goals. &nbsp; <br><br>In finding one's voice and connecting it to one's touch, three questions come to mind: "What shall I promise?" "Can the so-?called bottom line truly be the ?bottom line?" and "Who speaks for whom?" I hope you'll find your answers somewhere in this book. &nbsp; <br><br>You've recently been promoted. You're now a vice president or a provost or a department supervisor. Now the work begins. You haven't arrived, you've only begun to travel. In the same way, having children means only that the work of becoming a parent has begun. The biological event is very different from the love and commitment, the skinned knees and dirty diapers, the faithfulness to homework and Little League, the sacrifices for tuition and music lessons, the laughter and the tears-these kinds of things add up to earning the title "Mom" or "Dad." &nbsp; <br><br>One becomes a leader, I believe, through doing the work of a leader. It's often difficult and painful and sometimes even unrewarding, and it's work. There are also times of joy in the work of leadership, and doing the work of a leader is necessary in our society. &nbsp; <br><br>I hope that Leadership Jazz offers you some clues as to how leaders might act and what kind of thinking might precede action, whether you're parent or teacher, president or supervisor, preacher or member of Congress. I hope that reading this book will encourage you to see the breadth and depth of potential that exists in the work of every leader. I hope that you, too, will discover that so much of leadership is music from the heart. &nbsp; <br><br>Books that explain everything give only the author's point of view and leave little room for a reader to elaborate and connect and interpret through her own experiences and background. I have left room in Leadership Jazz for you to complete this book. I hope that you will read and write between the lines and improve what I have done. Authors and leaders who see only a limited need for the gifts of followers limit themselves to their own talents. I have tried to make this book inviting, but to complete the ideas may require a serious effort on your part. &nbsp; <br><br>I am not here as someone who has everything figured out but rather as one who struggles. I can't answer every question about leadership. The story goes that a German machine tool company once developed a very fine bit for drilling holes in steel. The tiny bit could bore a hole about the size of a human hair. This seemed like a tremendously valuable innovation. The Germans sent samples off to Russia, the United States, and Japan, suggesting that this bit was the ultimate in machining technology. &nbsp; <br><br>From the Russians, they heard nothing. From the Americans came a quick response inquiring as to the price of the bits, available discounts, and the possibility of a licensing arrangement. &nbsp; <br><br>After some delay, there was the predictable, polite response from the Japanese, complimenting the Germans on their achievement, but with a postscript noting that the Germans' bit was enclosed with a slight alteration. Excitedly, the German engineers opened the package, carefully examined their bit, and to their amazement discovered that the Japanese had bored a neat hole through it. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>A Key Called Promise &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;I have a key in my bosom, called Promise, that will, I am persuaded, open any lock in Doubting Castle.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress &nbsp;</i> <br><br>Leadership may be good work, but it&#x2019;s also a tough job. There is always more to do than time seems to allow. Measuring out both time to pursue one&#x2019;s own responsibilities and time to respond to the needs of others can be difficult. And leaders are constantly under pressure to make promises. &nbsp; <br><br>Though I&#x2019;m still learning things about being a leader, I can tell you at least two requirements of such a position: the need to give one&#x2019;s witness as a leader&#x2014;to make your promises to the people who allow you to lead; and the necessity of carrying out your promises. It sounds easier than it is. &nbsp; <br><br>One day Pat McNeal, a scheduler in the plant whom I&#x2019;d known for a good many years, called me to say that Valerie from the second shift wanted to talk to me about a very serious matter. At the time I was CEO. Not knowing me, she had asked Pat to pave the way into my office. Pat said, &#x201c;I want you to know that Valerie&#x2019;s a very dependable person. You would be wise to listen to what she has to say.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>A date was set and Valerie appeared. She began by asking me if I knew that a vice president had fired the relatively new manager of the second shift without following the prescribed procedures. I told her that no, I wasn&#x2019;t aware of this. She then gave me the entire story of the abrupt and unwarranted dismissal of not one, but two fine young managers of the second and third shifts by this vice president, who seemed to have lost his bearings. &nbsp; <br><br>Valerie then handed me a beautifully written petition outlining the qualifications of the second-?shift manager, his performance, and his relationship with all the people on the shift. Every person on the second shift had signed. &nbsp; Those of you who have had experience managing in manufacturing plants will understand the risk Valerie ran in circulating the petition and in coming to me. The careful investigation that followed proved Valerie and her co-?workers entirely correct and demonstrated that Valerie was serving Herman Miller (our company) well by protesting the firings. Valerie&#x2014;not her superior in the hierarchy&#x2014;was honoring corporate values and policies. She had put me and other senior managers in the position of living up to policies the company had clearly promised. Valerie was helping the leaders of the company to connect voice and touch.</p><h2>The Commanding Heights : The Battle for the World Economy</h2><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Prize</i> joins a leading expert on the global economy to present an incisive narrative of the risks and opportunities that are emerging as the balance of power shifts around the world between governments and markets -- and the battle over globalization comes front and center.<br><br>A brilliant narrative history, <i>The Commanding Heights </i>is about the most powerful economic forces at work in the world today, and about the people and the ideas that are shaping the future. Across the globe, it has become increasingly accepted dogma that economic activities should be dominated by market forces, not political concerns. With chapters on Europe, the US, Britain, the Third World, the Arab States, Asia, China, India, Latin America, and the former communist countries, Yergin and Stanislaw provide an incisive overview of the state of the economy, and of the battles between governments and markets in each region. Now updated throughout and with two new chapters, <i>The Commanding Heights</i> explains a revolution which is unfolding before our very eyes.</p><p>The "commanding heights," according to Pulitzer Prize-winner Daniel Yergin and international business advisor Joseph Stanislaw, are those dominant enterprises and industries that form the high economic ground in nations around the globe. In their analysis of the new world economy, <i>The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and the Marketplace That Is Remaking the Modern World</i>, they examine "the individuals, the ideas, the conflicts, and the turning points" that are responsible. And by considering events such as the ongoing Asian monetary crisis, they suggest what the ultimate interconnection of financial markets might mean in the future.Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and the Global Energy Expert for the CNBC business news network, is a highly respected authority on energy, international politics, and economics.

Garrett, along with photographer Denton Tillman, traveled throughout Europe visiting fellow brewmasters to trace the beers of the world to their sources. Back in the States, he met with the star chefs he has advised about beer. The resulting book is a motherload of information, lushly illustrated with Tillman&#x2019;s gorgeous photographs of the world&#x2019;s best beers and the breweries that produce them. Above all, THE BREWMASTER&#x2019;S TABLE is a new way of thinking about beer &#x2013; one that will bring this under-appreciated brew to the status it deserves.</p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s a Belgian wheat beer with a simple salad, a Brooklyn Pilsner to wash down spicy tacos, a pale ale alongside a porcini risotto with foie gras, or even a Framboise to accompany a dark chocolate brownie, beer is the perfect complement to any dining experience, at home in front of the TV or in a four-star restaurant. </p><p>He explains how beer is made, shows you its fascinating history, and then leads you through the amazing range of flavors displayed by the dozens of distinct styles of beer from around the world. Finally, he suggests beer pairings that will please your tastebuds and blow your mind. &nbsp;Whether you&#x2019;re a beer aficionado, a passionate cook, or just someone who loves a great dinner, this book will indeed be a revelation.</p></p><p><p>Traditional craft-brewed beer can transform a meal from everyday to extraordinary. It's an affordable, accessible luxury. Yet most people are only familiar with the mass-market variety. Have you tasted the real thing? </p><p>In <em>The Brewmaster's Table</em>, Garrett Oliver, America's foremost authority on beer and brewmaster of the acclaimed Brooklyn Brewery, reveals why real beer is the perfect partner to any dining experience. He explains how beer is made, relays its fascinating history, and, accompanied by Denny Tillman's exquisite photographs, conducts an insider's tour through the amazing range of flavors displayed by distinct styles of beer from around the world. Most important, he shows how real beer, which is far more versatile than wine, intensifies flavors when it's appropriately paired with foods, creating brilliant matches most people have never imagined: a brightly citric Belgian wheat beer with a goat cheese salad, a sharply aromatic pale ale to complement spicy tacos, an earthy German bock beer to match a porcini risotto, even a fruity framboise to accompany a slice of chocolate truffle cake. Whether you're a beer aficionado, a passionate cook, or just someone who loves a great dinner, this book will indeed be a revelation.</p>Garrett Oliver, author of <em>The Brewmaster's Table: Discovering The Pleasures of Real Beer with Real Food</em>, likens his role as Brewmaster at the award-winning Brooklyn Brewery in New York City to a chef: "The Brewmaster is essentially the chef of the brewery." <em>Gourmet</em> magazine described him as "a passionate epicure and talented alchemist." <p>In Oliver's new book, his expertise about beer is as entertaining and authoritative as his culinary tips, especially in the numerous savory beer and food matchups he recommends. How did Garrett Oliver come by these consuming passions?</p><p>After years of amateur brewing inspired by beers he had encountered during a year in England, Garrett Oliver began brewing professionally at Manhattan Brewing Company in 1989.

Garrett has hosted hundreds of beer tastings and dinners, writes regularly for beer and food-related periodicals, and is internationally recognized as an expert on traditional beer styles and their affinity with fine food. </p><p>In 1994, Oliver joined The Brooklyn Brewery as Brewmaster and partner. Many of his beers have won national and international awards. He has also served as a judge for the Professional Panel Blind Tasting of the Great American Beer Festival for eleven years, has judged the prestigious Great British Beer Festival competition five times, and the Beverage Industry International Awards twice. </p><p>Oliver has hosted tastings and talks for numerous cultural institutions, including the Smithsonian, MassMOCA, and The Jewish Museum. In the United States, Garrett has made numerous radio and television appearances as a spokesman for craft brewing, including segments on NPR, CNN, ABC, PBS, MSNBC, The History Channel, Food Network's <em>"Emeril Live</em>, and CBS' <em>Martha Stewart Living</em>. </p><p>Garrett has hosted beer tastings and dinners at many fine restaurants, cooking schools, and food events including dinners at James Beard House, Oceana, The Waldorf-Astoria, the Slow Food Cheese Festival and Salone del Gusto in Piemonte, Italy, The Association of Westchester Country Club Chefs, The American Institute of Wine and Food, The Culinary Institute of America, the Sommelier Society of America, The French Culinary Institute, and Peter Kump's New York Cooking School (now ICE), and the London BAR show.

Out of the dark tunnel of boring literary analysis assignments, they lead you into a world where students learn to write fresh, compelling, authentic arguments based on their own unique interests. "There is a place for analysis of literature in our classrooms," they write. "But we think there is more. In this book, we invite you to explore your teaching of analytical writing from a new perspective. To open your mind to the real world of analytical writing, and challenge traditional notions about what students should be analyzing and how they should write it."</p> <p>Allison and Rebekah offer a broadened definition of analysis for the 21st century classroom. "Analysis is everywhere," they argue. "It's about video games and athletes' seasons, and the latest album, or the new Netflix series." This new definition of "text" allows students to tap into their passions-and learn to write with expertise on topics that matter to them. "No matter where your students begin as writers-full of confidence or full of avoidance-unleashing them to explore the topics and texts they are passionate about can transform your classroom and transform their writing."</p> <p>With samples throughout the book, you'll see what students of all levels and experiences can do when they're supported with mentor texts, targeted writing instruction, and the opportunity to write beyond literary analysis.</p></p><p><p>Allison Marchetti is coauthor - with Rebekah O'Dell - of Writing with Mentors and Beyond Literary Analysis.

She has experience using the reading and writing workshop model to transform student engagement at all levels, from inclusion classrooms to the International Baccalaureate program. Grades: 6 - 12</p>"English teachers have been waiting for this book since...well...forever. Allison Marchetti and Rebekah O'Dell breathe new life into that semi-comatose assignment the analytic essay. They ask us to totally reimagine it, to examine how analysis works "in the wild" on blogs, web sites, Internet reviews, and to expand the range of "texts" students can analyze (music, video games, sports teams, movies). Then drawing on their own classroom work, they show how students can use the lessons from mentor texts in their own writing. A groundbreaking and absolutely essential book." --Thomas Newkirk, author of Minds Made for Stories<br><br>"Are you ready for a mind-bending journey into analytical writing? This book holds a new vision for student engagement grounded in current, authentic, and relevant texts. I guarantee it will upend your understanding of analysis. Full of sentence and passage studies that ignite student voice, mini-lessons that clarify the intent of organizational structures, and a deep understanding of how best to learn from a mentor text, this book will make you a better writing teacher. It s simply brilliant." --Penny Kittle, author of Book Love<br><br>"Allison Marchetti and Rebekah O Dell take the dusty skeleton of literary analysis and transform it into a responsive, sophisticated, magical genre of writing that we can teach our students to develop and to adore. Using this book will produce the writing that you and your students will cherish most these are the pieces they will keep, the ones they will publish. Marchetti and O Dell s work brings relevance, voice, and life to a form that feels crusty and brittle with directions, templates and redundancy. This book will make your students better writers but it will also help them to enter into the world they encounter with greater passion and insight than ever before."--Kate Roberts, coauthor of Falling in Love with Close Reading<br>"As tour guides to a brave new world, Rebekah O Dell and Allison Marchetti reject the well-worn path of literary analysis and guide teachers to a vibrant new analytical landscape. By reframing the idea of text as anything that has a beginning, middle, and end, O Dell and Marchetti entertain a bigger vision for analysis, that helps students find their passion, explore their ideas, assert authority, and build solid structures for writing. Divided into three sections, the book offers an inquiry into traditional analysis, a compendium of practical lessons, and an exploration of sub-genres, such as writing about movies, music, sports, and video games. In addition, this book is chock full of dynamic mentor texts and classroom-ready techniques that will free your students to explore the vistas vital to their lives." --Liz Prather, author of Project-Based Writing</p><h2>Galapagos Wildlife (Bradt Wildlife Guides)</h2><p><p>Traveling to the Gal�pagos to discover the unique flora and fauna that so captivated Darwin and the many that followed him is a rite of passage for serious wildlife enthusiasts.

As Maya grows, her blanket becomes worn and frayed, so with Grandma s help, Maya makes it into a dress. Over time the dress is made into a skirt, a shawl, a scarf, a hair ribbon, and finally, a bookmark. Each item has special, magical, meaning for Maya; it animates her adventures, protects her, or helps her in some way. But when Maya loses her bookmark, she preserves her memories by creating a book about her adventures and love of these items. When Maya grows up, she shares her book Maya s Blanket/La manta de Maya with her own little daughter while snuggled under her own special blanket. Inspired by the traditional Yiddish folk song Hob Ikh Mir a Mantl ( I Had a Little Coat ), this delightful story puts a child-focused, Latino spin on the tale of an item that is made into smaller and smaller items. Maya s Blanket/La manta de Maya charmingly brings to life this celebration creativity, recycling, and enduring family love.</p><p>Monica Brown, is the author of many award-winning bilingual books for children, many of which are inspired by her Peruvian American heritage. Monica is a Professor of English at Northern Arizona University, specializing in U.S. Latino Literature and Multicultural Literature. She lives in Flagstaff, Arizona.Following the narrative styles of a traditional Yiddish folk song, Maya s Blanket/La manta de Maya tells the story of a child s most beloved possession: her blue and green handmade blanket with purple butterfly stitches. Maya s grandmother made it to protect her from bad dreams. Yet as time passes and the blanket becomes worn and frayed, it is remade into a dress, a skirt, a shawl, and more. Similar to Nancy Andrews-Goebel s The Pot that Juan Built (Lee &amp; Low, 2002), the story repeatedly reminds readers of the creative transformations that Maya and her grandmother employ to turn the beloved blanket into another useful accessory. This book is a great storytime addition for school-aged children due to its sincere and simple writing that translates well in both Spanish and English, the representation of culturally diverse characters, and the underlying message of resourcefulness, imagination, and appreciation for family traditions. Readers will also be entranced by the eye-catching illustrations of Maya s ordinary-to-extraordinary life. Created with mixed media, the graphics are illuminating with rich color and texture. Thanks to the depth of the images and the thoughtful text, readers will thoroughly enjoy wondering what Maya s blanket will be next. VERDICT A Latino-influenced and Yiddish-inspired tale that is recommended for Spanish readers and librarians in diverse communities. --School Library Journal<br><br>A familiar tale crosses cultures with almost magical ease. The story is based on the well-known Jewish folk tale in which an old, worn coat is turned into a jacket, then a vest, then a tie, here given a warm, Latino spin. Not only does Brown's text alternate passages in English with sections in Spanish translated by Dom�nguez, but on some pages, nearly every sentence is written in two languages: "Maya made her manta into a vestido that she loved very much." The effect isn't subtle, and at first, every paragraph feels like a vocabulary lesson. But as the sentences get longer, the language becomes hypnotic. As Maya's blanket is recut and resewn, the words begin to sound like an incantation: "So with her own two hands and Abuelita's help, Maya made her rebozo that was her falda that was her vestido that was her manta into a bufanda that she loved very much." It sounds like a magic spell to preserve the garment for all time. Sometimes spells work: Maya turns the blanket into a story, the same picture book that is in readers' hands. Diaz's beautiful, mixed-media illustrations feel like another sort of magic. The moon looks like a pomegranate. A spinning jump rope looks like water shooting from a fountain. As the book ends, Maya's daughter is sleeping under "her own special, magical manta." Readers may be eager to tell their own versions of the story that's how magic works. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>In a tender bilingual story inspired by a Yiddish folksong, Maya s beloved butterfly-laden blanket, made by her abuelita passes through numerous incarnations. When the blanket frays, Maya and her grandmother fashion it into a dress and, later, a skirt. From there, it becomes a shawl, scarf, bookmark, and a story to pass down. In English and Spanish, Brown describes these transitions using a House That Jack Built structure: So with her own two hands and Abuelita s help, Maya made her vestido that was her manta into a falda that she loved very much. The angular poses and vivid colors of Diaz s illustrations evoke the feeling of stained-glass windows in this uplifting story of passing time, enduring love, and creative reuse. --Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Rethinking Sustainability</h2><p>When you first took the reins of a Christian school, did you discover that your graduated degree in school administration had not quite prepared you for the financial challenges of school leadership? Have you often operated in financial crises mode? If so, you re not alone: the very existence of many Christian schools is in jeopardy today because of financial issue! Drawing on his deep expertise and broad experience, Dr. Alan Pue has written this groundbreaking financial handbook for Christian school leaders. You will be challenged to examine you assumptions about Christian school finance, establish biblically sound financial principles, develop reliable streams of revenue-and much, much more! Are you concerned about the sustainability of your school? Dr. Pue s insight, warnings, and advice can help your school not only survive, but thrive!</p><p>Alan Pue, EhD, served for several years as a Christian school teacher, guidance counselor, coach, and headmaster at a school in Delaware. He also served as the senior vice president and the provost of the Master s College in California for five years. Dr. Pue is currently the president of the Barnabas Group. He travels extensively throughout North America speaking at Christian school conferences and working with ministry leaders in the areas of strategic planning, governance, and marketing. He is the author of more than two dozen published articles and a regular columnist for the SEAL, a leadership newsletter published by ACSI.Thanks, I needed that! Like the old slap-in-the-face aftershave commercial. Alan is calling us to take a hard look in our financial mirror, while giving us a timely (but loving) cuff across out administrative head. Through his veteran insight and experience, he has related a number of key principles, and confirmed one ... that the pain of not changing is growing greater than the pain of change. Bravo! --Bill Stevens, Head of School, Wilmington Christian School, Hockedssin, DE<br><br>Far too often, Christian school administrators find themselves fixated on important spiritual or educational matters and may ignore the need to manage finances with excellence as well. Alan Pue's book calls school leaders to a more balanced perspective. His relentless commitment to biblical principles and an utterly realistic budgeting process should encourage even the most experienced administrator. The section on the value of the budget emerging from strategic planning process is worth the price of the book. I highly recommend this resource for all Christian school leaders. --Sherry Worel Superintendent, Stoneybrooke Christian Schools, San Juan Capistrano, CA<br><br>A must-read for Christian school administrators desiring to establish responsible, God-honoring financial management. In engaging and convincing fashion, Dr. Pue addresses the gamut of fiscal issues facing Christian school leaders. From a foundation of nonnegotiable biblical principles to policies and practices for budgeting, setting tuitions rates and compensation levels, and resource procurement, he offers readers a plethora of practical insights for strategic money management particularly relevant for twenty-first-century Christian education institutions. --Gordon B.

Now he draws on Eastern philosophy, Buddhism, Japanese Psychology, Zen, and Martial Arts to offer an approach to ACTION that goes beyond productivity and time management. Most of us associate Eastern wisdom with meditation, but Krech demonstrates the importance of ACTION as an essential element in our spiritual and emotional health and provides the psychological tools that can help us move forward, even when feeling depressed, discouraged or just stuck. Weaving together an extraordinary collection of teachings, Krech addresses practical issues such as procrastination, stress, anxiety and indecision but through a lens of classic Eastern wisdom. Students of Buddhism, Yoga, meditation, mindfulness and Japanese culture, will resonate with the ideas Krech presents and come away with both inspiration and practical guidance for turning those ideas into ACTION. It&#x2019;s not just about getting things done, but about what you do, how you do it and the impact of your action (and inaction) on the world around you. Your karma. Your legacy. The world is waiting for you.</p><p>Gregg Krech is one of the leading authorities on Japanese Psychology in North America and is the founding Director of the ToDo Institute, an educational center for purposeful living in Vermont.

His work has been featured in a wide range of publications including a feature interview in THE SUN magazine, as well as articles in Tricycle, SELF, Utne Reader, Fitness, Counseling Today, Cosmopolitan and Experience Life. Gregg presents to diverse audiences ranging from mental health professionals to Zen practitioners throughout the world. He has been a featured speaker at national conferences on Buddhist Psychology, Mindfulness and Psychotherapy and Attention Deficit Disorder. His other books include A Natural Approach to Mental Wellness (ToDo Institute, 2011), and A Finger Pointing to the Moon (ToDo Institute, 1996, 2007).

Dodsworth promises the duck that if he can stay out of trouble while they take a bus tour, visit a museum, and attend a festival, he'll treat him to some wagashi, dessert. Predictably, the duck doesn't quite succeed, though he does inadvertently impress the locals and return the lost toy. When finally enjoying his long-awaited treat, he ends up making another mess, but his ever-patient companion just laughs.

The largest portion are teetering on the brink, in need of guidance to help them move forward: some are "dabblers" who pursue strings of disconnected interests with no real commitment; others, "dreamers" who have no realistic plans or understanding of what success will require. <br> <br> What makes the difference? Damon shows that the key ingredient for the highly engaged is that they have developed a clear sense of purpose in their lives that motivates them and gives them direction. Based on in-depth interviews, he takes readers inside the minds of the disengaged and drifting kids and exposes their confusion and anxiety about what they should do with their lives. He then offers compelling portraits of the young people who are thriving and identifies the nine key factors that have made the difference for them, presenting simple but powerful methods that parents and all adults can and must employ in order to cultivate that energized sense of purpose in young people that will launch them on the path to a deeply satisfying and productive life.</p><p><b>1</b><p></p>Young Lives Adrift<p>The life prospects of a young person in today's world are far from certain. Only a few decades ago, almost all young people knew by the end of adolescence where they would live, what their occupation would be, and whom they were going to marry. Today, most young people have no answers to these questions well into adulthood. The global economy has increased the opportunities, and pressures, for young people to move far from the communities that they grew up in. Even many of the best-educated will spend years in casual jobs without settling into a permanent line of work -- and, indeed, the whole notion of a permanent line of work has come into question, as many careers are evolving into a succession of relatively short-term, disconnected jobs. As for establishing their own families, young adults all over the world are deferring or declining marriage. If current trends continue, an increasing share of the youth population will never marry, or may wait until their childbearing years are almost past.1</p><p>Some of today's young welcome these changes and the new opportunities they offer. These young people have formulated clear aspirations for their future. They are strongly motivated, full of energy, optimistic, and have created realistic plans to accomplish their ambitions. Confident in themselves, they enjoy exploring the world and testing the limits of their potential. Far from needing any protection or prodding, they almost can't be held back. In a word, they have found a strong sense of <i>purpose</i> to inspire them and provide them with direction.</p><p>At the same time, many of their peers are floundering. In the face of the serious choices ahead of them as they move toward adulthood, they feel as though they are drifting or stalled in their personal and social development. A large portion of today's young people are hesitating to make commitments to any of the roles that define adult life, such as parent, worker, spouse, or citizen.</p><p>This delayed commitment among the young is taking place today all over the industrial world, from the United States to Japan to Europe. In Italy, to cite one extreme case, it has been reported that the <i>majority</i> of thirty-year-olds still live at home with their parents and are neither married nor fully employed. In the United States, a study of youth in their late teens and early twenties concluded: "Marriage, home, and children are seen by most of them not as achievements to be pursued but as perils to be avoided."2</p><p>The British government was the first to officially recognize the growing phenomenon of unoccupied young adults when, in a national report five years ago, it coined the term "Young NEETs" ("Not in Education, Employment, or Training").3 Recently, the Japanese government has reported, with evident alarm, that almost a million of its own youthful population had become NEETs -- and this in a society long known for its strong intergenerational work ethic. None of these reports has cited any economic slowdown as the problem. The economy in Europe, Asia, the United States, and other parts of the industrial world has been growing rapidly enough to offer plentiful employment opportunities for the young. But many are holding back. Perhaps they are daunted by the uncertainties they face, perhaps they are fearful of perils they perceive in the choices they might make, or perhaps they consider the prospects available to them to be uninspiring and devoid of meaning. The reasons behind their hesitation often seem mysterious to parents and educators, many of whom are becoming concerned that these young people have yet to find the kinds of engagements and commitments that make life fulfilling.</p><p>Many parents are also voicing the concern -- often humorously at first, but less so over time -- that their progeny may become "boomerangers," returning to their home nests long after they were supposed to have flown away on their own wings. I've come to call this the "How can I get my wonderful daughter to move out of our basement?" question. Of course, not all parents are troubled by seeing their children take some extra time to strike out on their own, and there is a positive side to the story: it does indicate a closeness that has eluded many families in prior decades. These days, grown children feel comfortable staying in their family homes, and they do actually seem to enjoy hanging around their parents and communicating with them much more openly than did people of the boomer generation when they themselves were young.</p><p>A bit of light on this matter was shed by a May 2007 <i>Fortune</i> magazine piece on "baby boomers' kids," written delightfully by Nadira Hira, who identifies herself as one of those kids.4 Extolling (correctly) the extraordinary talent, energy, and creativity that mark her cohort of young people, the author makes the case that "all that questioning" that her peers are doing "will lead us to some important answers." In the meantime, the extended period of questioning and self-exploration is delaying that transition to permanent work and a home of their own far beyond that of any prior generation. Hira cites a survey of American college students from 2000 through 2006 showing that almost two thirds of the graduates moved home after college and over half of these stayed for more than a year. She quotes one twenty-eight-year-old (who himself wrote a book on the subject5) as saying: "If we don't like a job, we quit, because the worst thing that can happen is that we move back home. There's no stigma...our moms would love nothing more than to cook our favorite meatloaf." Another young adult, a twenty-four-year-old woman, echoes this sentiment: "I think parents want to feel needed, and it's like, because I'm so independent, they get excited when I ask for a favor."</p><p>Now, parental love for children is one of the world's great blessings; and it is true, fortunately, that most parents will gladly do anything to help their children get along. Also, it is unambiguously a good thing that most children feel secure in their expectations that parents will provide for their needs. But I am not convinced that most parents hope to spend their golden years providing basic needs for their children; nor do I believe that this truly would be in the best interests of the children themselves. What <i>is</i> in children's best interests is to find ways to make their own contributions to their families and eventually to the world beyond themselves.</p><p>The ultimate problem is not the parent's role in the child's life but rather the child's own personal fulfillment. During the adolescent years, a certain amount of soul-searching and experimentation is healthy. Adolescence is a transitory period of development, a kind of way station on the road to a mature self-identity.6 This formative period of life is said to begin with the onset of puberty and end with a firm commitment to adult social roles, such as those cited earlier: parent, spouse, worker, and citizen.7 During this key time of transition to adulthood, it is sensible for young people to spend time examining themselves, considering their futures, and looking around for the opportunities that best suit their own ambitions and interests. For many young people, an extended period of exploration and reflection during adolescence may be necessary to establish a fulfilling self-identity and a positive direction in life. This is what the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson once described as a constructive "moratorium" from reality. And yes, this "identity formation" task in some cases can take years of postponing choices in order to resolve the task successfully.8</p><p>Yet the postponements of many young people today have taken on a troubling set of characteristics, and chief among them is that so many youth do not seem to be moving toward any resolution. Their delay is characterized more by indecision than by motivated reflection, more by confusion than by the pursuit of clear goals, more by ambivalence than by determination. Directionless drift is not a constructive moratorium in either a developmental or a societal sense. Without a sense of direction, opportunities are lost, and doubt and self-absorption can set in. Maladaptive habits are established and adaptive ones are not built. It is not that there is a critical period for the acquisition of a fruitful direction in life. But it is the case that excessive delay beyond the period of readiness creates the serious risk that the young person may give up altogether on the tasks of finding a positive direction, sustaining that direction, and acquiring the skills needed to achieve the directional goals.</p><p>Today's young people are well aware that they will need to make a transition from adolescence to adulthood at some point; but for too many of them, this awareness -- which can be a source of keen anticipation for those who look to their futures with hope -- triggers a sense of vague foreboding or worse, a debilitating anxiety that can lead to further developmental paralysis. Indeed, extended disengagement from adult social roles is a prescription for anxiety and depression. To remain uncommitted to career, family, and other serious community responsibilities is an untenable position for a young person to settle into. Such disengagement becomes increasingly uncomfortable over time. It cannot continue indefinitely without psychological costs.</p><p>I do not wish to suggest that most of today's young are in "deep trouble" or any kind of immediate peril. In fact, the most visible indicators of youth well-being look somewhat better today, or at least not worse, than they did ten or fifteen years ago. In the United States, today's young people are less likely than the young of ten years ago to become pregnant while still teenagers; they are less prone to violence and crime; they are somewhat less vulnerable to the lure of addictive drugs; and they are no more prone to major eating disorders (with the exception of obesity, which is still on the rise among youngsters and adults alike). Most students are staying in school for more years and are attending c...</p><i>The Path to Purpose</i> is a beautiful and important book.

O&#x2019;Connor discovers how this legendary coach shaped the people he met and worked with in ways perhaps even Belichick himself doesn&#x2019;t know.

Are you ready?</strong></p> <p>Look around you. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a futuristic notion. It's here right now--in software that senses what we need, supply chains that "think" in real time, and robots that respond to changes in their environment. Twenty-first-century pioneer companies are already using AI to innovate and grow <em>fast</em>. The bottom line is this: Businesses that understand how to harness AI can surge ahead. Those that neglect it will fall behind. Which side are you on?</p> <p>In <em>Human + Machine</em>, Accenture leaders Paul R. Daugherty and H. James (Jim) Wilson show that the essence of the AI paradigm shift is the transformation of all <em>business processes</em> within an organization--whether related to breakthrough innovation, everyday customer service, or personal productivity habits. As humans and smart machines collaborate ever more closely, work processes become more fluid and adaptive, enabling companies to change them on the fly--or to completely reimagine them. AI is changing all the rules of how companies operate.</p> <p>Based on the authors' experience and research with 1,500 organizations, the book reveals how companies are using the new rules of AI to leap ahead on innovation and profitability, as well as what you can do to achieve similar results. It describes six entirely new types of hybrid human + machine roles that every company must develop, and it includes a "leader&#x2019;s guide" with the five crucial principles required to become an AI-fueled business.</p> <p><em>Human + Machine</em> provides the missing and much-needed management playbook for success in our new age of AI.</p> <p><strong>BOOK PROCEEDS FOR THE AI GENERATION</strong><br>The authors' goal in publishing <em>Human + Machine</em> is to help executives, workers, students and others navigate the changes that AI is making to business and the economy. They believe AI will bring innovations that truly improve the way the world works and lives. However, AI will cause disruption, and many people will need education, training and support to prepare for the newly created jobs.

Brenda travels all over the world giving talks on canine aggression and learning theory.Brenda Aloff is a pioneer in our field. Clicker trainers have proven that it can be done with competition obedience, agility, flyball, service dogs, indeed in all fields of what might be called performance training.

Only Zahrah can save him, but to do so she&#x2019;ll have to face her worst fears alone, including the very thing that makes her different.</p><p>Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu&#x2019;s short stories have been published in anthologies and magazines, including Dark Matter II, Strange Horizons, and Writers of the Future, Volume XVIII. Nnedi lives with her daughter, Anyaugo, and family in Illinois.Prologue My World When I was born, my mother took one look at me and laughed.<br> She&#x2019;s . . . dada,&#x201d; said the doctor, looking surprised. I can see that,&#x201d; my mother replied with a smile. She took me in her arms and gently touched one of the thick clumps of hair growing from my little head. I had dadalocks, and woven inside each one of those clumps was a skinny, light green vine. Contrary to what a lot of people think, these vines didn&#x2019;t sprout directly from my head. Instead, they were more like plants that had attached themselves to my hair as I grew inside my mother&#x2019;s womb. Imagine that! To be born with vines growing in your hair! But that&#x2019;s the nature of dada people, like myself.<br> Look, she&#x2019;s smiling,&#x201d; my father said. As if she already knows she&#x2019;s dada.&#x201d; To many, to be dada meant you were born with strange powers. That you could walk into a room and a mysterious wind would knock things over or clocks would automatically stop; that your mere presence would cause flowers to grow underneath the soil instead of above. That you caused things to rebel or that you would grow up to be rebellious yourself! And what made things even worse was that I was a girl, and only boys and men were supposed to be rebellious. Girls were supposed to be soft, quiet, and pleasant. Thankfully, when I was born, my parents were open-minded, well educated, and familiar with some of the older stories about dada people. These stories said that the dada-born were destined to be wise beings, not necessarily rebels. As a result, my parents didn&#x2019;t cut my hair, and they weren&#x2019;t scared by it either. Instead they let it grow and, as I got older, made sure I understood that being dada was not a curse. In fact, it was a blessing, because it was a part of me, they said. Of course I didn&#x2019;t feel this way when I was old enough to go to school and my classmates called me names. Now I&#x2019;m fourteen and my dada hair has grown way down my back. Also, the vines inside are thicker and dark green. Sometimes all this hair is heavy, but I&#x2019;m used to it. My mother says it forces me to hold my head up higher.<br><br>********<br><br>A large part of the culture in the northern Ooni Kingdom where I live is to look civilized.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s northern slang for stylish. There&#x2019;s no way the typical northerner would go outside without wearing his or her most civilized clothes and looking clean and nice. Not even for a second. We all carry mirrors in our pockets, and we take them out every so often to inspect our reflection and make sure we look good. On top of that, our clothes click with tiny style mirrors embedded into the collars and hems. They&#x2019;re really lovely. I have a dress with style mirrors sewn all over it. Sometimes when I&#x2019;m alone I like to put it on and dance in the sunlight. The reflections from the little mirrors look like white insects dancing along with me. My people love to use mirrors everywhere, actually. If you go to the downtown area of the great city of Ile-Ife, you&#x2019;ll understand what I&#x2019;m talking about. Downtown, many giant plant towers reach high into the sky. In my history class, I learned that every year, the ten tallest plant towers grow ten inches higher and five inches wider and that they&#x2019;re thousands of years old. At one time, long ago, they weren&#x2019;t even inhabited by human beings, as they are now. There were no elevators or computer networks or offices or living spaces inside. They were just big big plants! The Ooni Palace Tower is the tallest (standing 4,188 feet high) and oldest of them all. That&#x2019;s where the chief of Ooni and his counsel reside. The top of the building blooms into a giant blue flower with purple petals. My father told me that this flower serves as a netevision transmitter for most of the Ooni Kingdom. Even this far north in Kirki, it&#x2019;s a beautiful sight, especially at night. Anyway, from up in any of the plant towers, you can see the north with all its mirrors shining like a giant galaxy, especially on sunny days. Our homes and buildings are encrusted with thousands of mirrors, inside and out. And there&#x2019;s always sand in the streets from those messy trucks transporting the grains to the factories to make even more mirrors.<br>Some like to say that northerners are arrogant and vain. But it&#x2019;s just our culture. And look at the four other ethnic groups of the Ooni Kingdom. They have unique customs, too. I just find them interesting, as opposed to wrong.<br>The northwesterners cook all day and most of the night! Over there you can practically eat the air, and everyone is gloriously fat! The people of the southwest are as obsessed with beads as we northerners are with mirrors. People wear them everywhere: around their ankles, arms, necks, on their clothes. The people of the southeast make aall things metal.

During the past two weeks, I&#x2019;ve been doing some research, and now I&#x2019;m starting to understand the reason for this prejudiced attitude. It&#x2019;s not just the northern culture that made people react badly to my dada hair. It&#x2019;s a general fear of the unknown that plagues the entire society of the Ooni Kingdom, a discomfort with things that may have been forgotten. And maybe my hair gives people a glimpse of memories they can&#x2019;t quite remember. Have you ever tried to recall something but couldn&#x2019;t and it was right on the tip of your tongue?

But behind the family's proud piety and beautiful old-timey music lay Pilgrim's dark past:&nbsp;his strange&nbsp;&nbsp;connection to the Kennedy assassination and a trail of chaos and anguish that followed him from Dallas and New Mexico.&nbsp;Pilgrim soon sparked a tense confrontation with the National Park Service fiercely dividing the community over where a citizen&#x2019;s rights end and the government&#x2019;s power begins. As the battle grew more intense, the turmoil in his brood made it increasingly difficult to tell whether his children were messianic followers or hostages in desperate need of rescue.&nbsp;<br><br>In this powerful piece of Americana, written with uncommon grace and high drama, veteran Alaska journalist, Tom Kizzia uses his unparalleled access to capture an era-defining clash between environmentalists and pioneers ignited by a mesmerizing sociopath who held a town and a family captive.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Year for 2013: </strong>When the "Pilgrim" family rolled into the old mining outpost of McCarthy, Alaska, they were a sight to behold: Robert "Papa Pilgrim" Hale, his wife Country Rose, and their 15 children--an old-fashioned, piously Christian family from another time, packed into two ramshackle campers. Looking for the space and freedom to live out their lives as they pleased, they were welcomed as kindred souls by the ghost town's few residents. A tad eccentric, they quickly ingratiated themselves into the tiny frontier community through Papa's charisma, their apparent dedication to self-reliance, and occasional family performances of their unique blend of gospel and bluegrass, music that seemed to soar on the conviction of their beliefs. And when they purchased an old mining claim in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park with plans to permanently settle there (dubbing it &#x201c;Hillbilly Heaven&#x201d;), it seemed the Pilgrim family had come home to the last existing place in America that suited them.</p> <p>But Hale chafed against the regulations that came with being a National Park inholder, and he quickly adopted an adversarial stance with the NPS, refusing to communicate with or even acknowledge its rangers. Everything went sideways when he bulldozed a road to town across national park lands, stopping just short of McCarthy in an attempt to avoid scrutiny. It didn't work. When the road was discovered by backpackers, NPS agents were fast on the scene and all over the Pilgrims' activities, and suddenly the humble hermit became a lightning rod for property-rights activists in McCarthy, Alaska, and far beyond.</p> <p>That's where Tom Kizzia entered the story. As a reporter for the Anchorage Daily News, he wrote a series of lengthy articles on the family's struggle with the federal government, and he soon discovered that Papa's past belied the tales he told about himself and his clan. This simple man of faith carried a long, strange, and troubled history: the violent death of his first wife, whom he married when she was 16, and who also happened to be the daughter of Texas governor John Connally; his hippie phase (when he went by the name "Sunstar"), filled with drug-fueled epiphanies and raging outbursts; a contentious relationship with his neighbors in the New Mexico wilderness, who accused Hale of casual disregard for laws that didn't suit his interests (especially the ones related to "Thou shalt not steal"); and worst of all, a dominion over his children that hinted at the most vile forms of abuse. As the situation with the NPS degraded and grew more tense, Hale's behavior became more erratic, driving himself and the entire town toward a denouement reminiscent of <em>Night of the Hunter</em> and Robert Mitchum&#x2019;s own creepy and deranged (if fictional) preacher.</p> <p>With <em>Pilgrim's Wilderness</em>, Kizzia has expanded on his original reporting and written a spellbinding tale of narcissism and religious mania's concussive effects on Hale's family and adopted town, a book that's likely to end up on many 2013 Best Of lists.<em>--Jon Foro</em></p> <p><b>Sample images from <em>Pilgrim's Wilderness</em></b></p> <em> </em> The ghost town of McCarthy in the winter of 1983,<br> the year six residents died in a mass murder on mail<br> plane day.

Witty, provocative and searching, this lively catalogue of female roles inspired by the movies crystallizes widespread concerns in our culture, examining the ways we shape our personal identities and the role of the mass media in our lives. Sherman began making these pictures in 1977 when she was 23 years old. The first six were an experiment: fan-magazine glimpses into the life (or roles) of an imaginary blond actress, played by Sherman herself. The photographs look like movie stills--or perhaps publicity pix--purporting to catch the blond bombshell in unguarded moments at home. The protagonist is shown preening in the kitchen and lounging in the bedroom. Onto something big, Sherman tried other characters in other roles: the chic starlet at her seaside hideaway, the luscious librarian, the domesticated sex kitten, the hot-blooded woman of the people, the ice-cold sophisticate and a can-can line of other stereotypes. She eventually completed the series in 1980. She stopped, she has explained, when she ran out of clich�s.<br><br>Other artists had drawn upon popular culture but Sherman's strategy was new. For her the pop-culture image was not a subject (as it had been for Walker Evans) or raw material (as it had been for Andy Warhol) but a whole artistic vocabulary, ready-made. Her film stills look and function just like the real ones--those 8 x 10 glossies designed to lure us into a drama we find all the more compelling because we know it isn't real. In the <i>Untitled Film Stills</i> there are no Cleopatras, no ladies on trains, no women of a certain age. There are, of course, no men. The 69 solitary heroines map a particular constellation of fictional femininity that took hold in postwar America--the period of Sherman's youth and the starting point for our contemporary mythology. In finding a form for her own sensibility, Sherman touched a sensitive nerve in the culture at large. Although most of the characters are invented, we sense right away that we already know them. That twinge of instant recognition is what makes the series tick and it arises from Cindy Sherman's uncanny poise. There is no wink at the viewer, no open irony, no camp.<br><br>In 1995, The Museum of Modern Art purchased the series from the artist, preserving the work in its entirety. This book marks the first time that the complete series will be published as a unified work, with Sherman herself arranging the pictures in sequence.</p><p><p><strong>Cindy Sherman</strong> is a ground-breaking American photographer, born in 1954. She began her "Film Stills" series at the age of 23, gaining early recognition, and has followed it with remarkable experiments in color photography. Her art has won her wide recognition and praise, and been collected and exhibited by major museums throughout the world since 1980. A major retrospective exhibition of her work was shown at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Dallas Museum of Art. Sherman is the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation "genius" award and a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. She is represented by Metro Pictures gallery in New York.</p>Sherman's provocative and much-discussed Untitled Film Stills series, created between 1977 and 1980, is collected for the first time in this 9.5" x 11.25" volume from MoMA, which purchased the entire set of 69 shots in 1995. Sherman's mysterious and perplexing "portraits" should not really be called "self," since Sherman appears solely in the guises of others, donning the clothing, wigs and makeup of various female '50s and '60s film "types" (the forgotten wife, the boozy hussy, the working girl, etc.) and elevating the art of playing dress-up to a whole new level. In her disarmingly honest introduction to the book, Sherman says of the European film stars like Simone Signoret, Sophia Loren or Jeanne Moreau, from whom she drew her inspiration, "What I was interested in was when they were almost expressionless," a rare occurrence in posed and artificial publicity shots. But while Sherman's photographs may initially resemble film stills, their grainy, dodgy quality (Sherman says, "I didn't care much about the print quality; the photographs were supposed to look like they cost fifty cents"); her disturbingly blank expression and chameleon-like ability to disappear into character; and the backgrounds of empty New York City streets and rundown lofts (in some ways, the photos act as a historical archive of a time when a less-gentrified New York functioned as a giant playground for artists) all conspire to give necessary dissonance to the myths Sherman explores. Sherman began making the series at the age of 23, and it soon established her as a major voice in the contemporary art scene, adding a much-needed female presence in what is more often than not a hyper-macho field. In the process of questioning the portrayal of women, Sherman questioned the art of portraiture itself and its uneasy place in 20th-century American society, opening a different path on which to proceed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Skyscrapers on street corners appeared to loom out toward her like the bows of giant ships. Tree branches projected upward and outward, enclosing and commanding palpable volumes of space. Leaves created intricate mosaics in 3D. <br><br>Barry had been cross-eyed and stereoblind since early infancy. After half a century of perceiving her surroundings as flat and compressed, on that day she saw the city of Manhattan in stereo depth for first time in her life. As a neuroscientist, she understood just how extraordinary this transformation was, not only for herself but for the scientific understanding of the human brain. Scientists have long believed that the brain is malleable only during a "critical period" in early childhood. According to this theory, Barry's brain had organized itself when she was a baby to avoid double vision - and there was no way to rewire it as an adult. But Barry found an optometrist who prescribed a little-known program of vision therapy; after intensive training, Barry was ultimately able to accomplish what other scientists and even she herself had once considered impossible. Dubbed "Stereo Sue" by renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks, Susan Barry tells her own remarkable journey and celebrates the joyous pleasure of our senses.<br><br></p><p><b>Susan R. Barry</b> is a professor of neurobiology in the Department of Biological Sciences at Mount Holyoke College.

A rush of icy, pine-scented air surrounded Ben as he donned his tan Stetson and stepped onto the sidewalk. It smelled like home and reminded him how glad he was to be back in Mystic Creek, not just for a visit, but living on his ranch again.</p><p>Liquidating his business as a rodeo stock broker hadn&#x2019;t been an easy decision. He&#x2019;d made damned good money. But it kept him on the road most of the time, often in flat, arid country where only a few bushy trees dotted the landscape. He&#x2019;d quickly grown tired of the constant traveling, but he&#x2019;d stuck it out to build a nice nest egg. Now he had finally quit, returned to his roots, and was trying to build a real life.</p><p>Because it had been sunny when he left home, he&#x2019;d forgotten a jacket, so all he could do was hunch his shoulders against the frigid temperature. His new Dodge Ram waited along the curb only paces away. Against the backdrop of late nineteenth-century storefronts that characterized Mystic Creek, it looked futuristic in the grayish light that always bathed the town as the sun started its slide into oblivion.</p><p>The smooth soles of his riding boots lost traction, warning him that the concrete was icy. In mid-September, Mystic Creek sometimes had weather fluctuations, warm one minute and freezing the next. Stupid not to bring a coat, he thought. This is high-elevation Oregon. He guessed he&#x2019;d been gone too long. Climatic habits ingrained in him during boyhood had lost their hold on him.</p><p>Walking to his vehicle, he saw his dog, Finnegan, watching him through the back cab window. Eight months old, the blue merle Australian shepherd had the mottle of black, gray, and white fur common to blues, but his markings were distinct, his narrow nose and forehead sporting a tapering white blaze. He bounced from side to side on the bench seat, acting as if he&#x2019;d been alone for hours.</p><p>A smile touched Ben&#x2019;s mouth. A bachelor and now thirty years old, he enjoyed having a dog. When Ben first returned to live on his ranch, the big, rambling house had felt empty when he stayed there alone. He&#x2019;d grown up in a large family. He preferred noise buzzing around him. Finn had provided the perfect antidote, snuggling with Ben in the recliner while he watched TV or read novels, always eager to play, barking joyously, and offering a warm presence beside him in bed at night. Hello, when a man couldn&#x2019;t find Miss Right, no matter how hard he searched, sometimes he had to settle for companionship from a four-legged friend. There were worse fates than being loved by a dog.</p><p>Not that Ben didn&#x2019;t keep company with women. He just couldn&#x2019;t find that one special lady he wanted to be with for a lifetime. Dating at thirty was a crapshoot with lots of promising beginnings followed by disappointing endings. He couldn&#x2019;t find anyone who truly loved animals, for one thing, and his life revolved around all kinds of them. He&#x2019;d met a few gals that had a cat, bird, or goldfish, but they didn&#x2019;t want a dog in the house. Or they were afraid of horses. A number of them had even visited his ranch in high heels and gotten pissed if they stepped in manure. He couldn&#x2019;t build a future with someone like that. He needed a down-to-earth person who didn&#x2019;t run in terror from his free-range chickens or pick dog hair off her fancy clothes.</p><p>As he circled the truck to the driver&#x2019;s door, delicious aromas drifted across the street from the Straw Hat, which served Mexican cuisine, and the Cauldron, another eatery in Mystic Creek, which specialized in home-style fare. Ben enjoyed eating at the Cauldron, and apparently so did many others. Through the front windows, he could see that the place was packed. The menu offered a wide variety of homemade choices, and the prices were also easy on the wallet.</p><p>There was only one fly in the ointment for Ben where the Cauldron was concerned, the caf�&#x2019;s owner, Sissy Sue Bentley. She was a petite woman with cropped dark hair, blue eyes that dominated her heart-shaped face, and a figure that was perfection on a small scale. She&#x2019;d caught his attention over a year ago, and he&#x2019;d started patronizing her establishment, hoping to get better acquainted. Despite his efforts to be friendly, she&#x2019;d treated him as if he had a contagious disease. After a couple of weeks, he&#x2019;d started to feel like a stalker and chalked it up to bad chemistry. Now he avoided the place.</p><p>Sissy wasn&#x2019;t the only pretty female in the area, after all. On weekend nights, he sometimes frequented the nightspots in nearby Crystal Falls, hoping to meet someone he could relate to. So far, he&#x2019;d run across several gals who were stunning, and a few intriguing enough to date for a couple of months. In the end, though, even if the sex was great, there was always something to put the kibosh on the relationship. It was just his luck that the only local woman he found attractive had taken an instant dislike to him.</p><p>As Ben pulled open the truck door, Finn leaped forward and slathered his face with doggy kisses. Ben laughed and gave the pup an enthusiastic scratch behind both ears. &#x201c;I missed you, too.&#x201d; He gently pushed the shepherd off the driver&#x2019;s seat and started to climb inside the vehicle.</p><p>A familiar sound stopped him dead in his tracks. Berk, berk, berk. He swung around and did a double take. A white hen was strutting eastward along the street. Ben had seen some strange sights in Mystic Creek. One time a skunk had joined the participants of a Fourth of July parade and cleared the sidewalks of people with one threatening lift of its tail. More recently, a black bear had moseyed onto East Main and pushed its way through the swinging doors of the Jake &#x2019;n&#x2019; Bake and devoured everything in the pastry section while Jake hid in the cooler until law officers arrived.</p><p>Now it was a chicken invading the downtown area. Where had it come from?</p><p>Just then, two more hens fell in behind the white leghorn, all three of the fowl covering ground at a pace suggesting they were late to an appointment. Finnegan barked. He was used to seeing chickens at home, but never within the city limits.</p><p>What the hell? Ben looked in the direction from which the chickens were coming and saw more feathery pedestrians appearing from behind the last building on the opposite side of the street. It housed Marilyn Fears&#x2019;s One-Stop Market, a small mom-and-pop shop. Had Marilyn decided to raise chickens? It was a popular hobby, and so far as Ben knew, the town had no ordinances against it.</p><p>Marilyn had space behind her building for a coop and run. A small distributary of Mystic Creek flowed behind the shops on that side of West Main, so the land back there hadn&#x2019;t been developed. Diverting the stream&#x2019;s natural course wasn&#x2019;t an option. In this town, nobody messed with Mystic Creek. The waterway was thought to be magical by many people, and even a narrow brook originating from it was revered.</p><p>As Ben watched, the flow of hens didn&#x2019;t abate. How many chicks had Marilyn ordered? As Ben stood there, dumbfounded, even more chickens appeared. Beckoning Finn out of the truck in case he needed the dog&#x2019;s help with bird herding, he gingerly headed toward the store. If Marilyn&#x2019;s chickens were loose, she&#x2019;d need help collecting them. The ones he&#x2019;d seen were pullets, not yet full-grown, and at an age when hens were sometimes warier of humans than they might be later. He didn&#x2019;t want that nice older lady to fall on the ice and get hurt.</p><p>As Ben circled the store, he noticed the dim interior beyond the front window, which sported a glowing sign that read CLOSED. It was Friday night and only shortly after six. Though a gloaming heralded the approach of nightfall, full darkness wouldn&#x2019;t descend for a while. He guessed the market mostly got business from nine to five on weekdays, allowing Marilyn, who lived in the upstairs flat, to lock up early.</p><p>The oncoming birds made Ben feel as if he were going the wrong direction on a one-way thoroughfare. As he turned the corner at the back of the building, his gaze followed the line of fleeing chickens to the property behind the Cauldron. Shit. Through the deepening gloom, he saw a tiny coop in Sissy&#x2019;s backyard&#x2014;one of those DIY kits. Attached to it was a pathetic wire run. She probably didn&#x2019;t know her chickens were loose, and even if she did, the Cauldron appeared to be packed with customers. The last time Ben had eaten there, Sissy had still been doing a one-woman show, rushing to service tables, pinning slips to the order wheel, and then racing into the kitchen to cook.</p><p>Just then Ben saw her dart from behind the coop in pursuit of a brown hen. She lunged at her target, slipped, and did a belly flop on the ground. Ben winced. The lady had been unfriendly to him in the past, greeting his polite overtures with icy disdain. He owed her nothing and almost made a U-turn. But the fowl had fled in all directions, and Ben&#x2019;s dad, Jeremiah, had raised him to always offer his help when someone else was in a jam.</p><p>Snapping his fingers to keep the dog beside him, Ben hurried across Marilyn&#x2019;s lawn to Sissy&#x2019;s dirt yard. Finn trembled with excitement. &#x201c;Do you need some help?&#x201d;</p><p>Startled by Ben&#x2019;s voice, Sissy whirled to face him. Even with dirt smeared on her cheek and across the front of her white chef&#x2019;s coat, she was still cuter than a button. Her short, dark hair, which covered her ears in wisps to frame her cheeks, was tousled and peppered with wood chips. Some of the old folks in town said Sissy was the spitting image of Audrey Hepburn. Not long ago, Ben&#x2019;s mom and sisters had insisted that he watch Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s with them. Except for the difference in eye color, Sissy definitely resembled Hepburn.</p><p>His gut tightened. He didn&#x2019;t get what it was about Sissy that drew his interest, but when she turned that wary blue gaze on him, he wanted to reassure her.</p><p>She gestured at the fleeing chickens and cried, &#x201c;Nobody ever told me they can fly! What kind of hatchery sells chicks to people without telling them that?&#x201d;</p><p>Ben wondered if this was a trick question. &#x201c;Um, well, they are birds. Right?&#x201d;</p><p>She placed her fine-boned hands on her hips. &#x201c;Not all birds can fly. Penguins, for instance! And emus! Name me one time you saw a chicken soaring in the sky!&#x201d;</p><p>Ben struggled not to grin. For once, she was actually speaking to him without an order tablet in her hand. Now was not a good time to pop back with a smart-ass comment. &#x201c;Not often, I have to admit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not often? I&#x2019;ve never seen a chicken fly!&#x201d;</p><p>Ben glanced at the hens going airborne to get over the sagging wall of the run. &#x201c;That could be because all the chickens you&#x2019;ve ever seen had their wings clipped.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Clipped?&#x201d; She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;What parts are clipped? All I know is my whole flock is loose, my caf� is filled with customers, I have food on the stove, and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She gulped and her cheeks puffed out with her deep breaths.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be happy to help,&#x201d; he offered.</p><p>With a jerk of her shoulders and a lift of her chin, she stood tall&#x2014;well, as tall as someone of her diminutive stature could manage. In her ice queen voice, she informed him, &#x201c;I think I can handle it by myself.&#x201d;</p><p>That stuffs it, Ben thought. She hadn&#x2019;t even bothered to thank him for offering. His father may have raised him to be a good guy, but not a fool. Just as he turned to walk away, thinking up a rejoinder he&#x2019;d never say aloud to her, a white leghorn flapped past him. Before he could stop himself, he shot out a hand, caught both its legs in his grip, and tipped it upside down, a quick, humane way to prevent all the struggling and squawking that might have ensued.</p><p>I need lessons in how to be a convincing jerk, Ben thought. She doesn&#x2019;t want my help. She&#x2019;s made that clear. And now I&#x2019;ve caught one of her damned hens. Angry with himself for being a pushover, he started toward her pathetic excuse for a run. The brown hen she&#x2019;d been chasing now perched on the sagging wire. Ben snatched it up by its legs, turned it head down, and met Sissy at the jerry-rigged gate.</p><p>She flashed him an incredulous look. &#x201c;How did you do that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There really isn&#x2019;t much to it.&#x201d;</p><p>She glanced at the two birds hanging almost lifeless at his sides. Not wanting her to think his technique was abusive, Ben said, &#x201c;This is how many poultry wranglers do it. All the fight goes out of the chickens, and it&#x2019;s safer for them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re hired.&#x201d;</p><p>Ben nearly told her she couldn&#x2019;t afford him. But in good conscience, he couldn&#x2019;t let the hens run free all night. They might die of exposure, or fall victim to predators. He glanced at his dog, still quivering with excitement. The pup was already proving to be a good herder, and Ben had used him often to round up his chickens after a day of free range.</p><p>He snapped his fingers and pointed at a buff Orpington. &#x201c;Good boy, Finn! Bring &#x2019;em in.&#x201d;</p><p>Finnegan leaped into action. While he expertly steered three terrified hens toward home, Ben dumped his captives inside the run, caught two more, and opened the makeshift gate to facilitate his dog&#x2019;s efforts. After Finnegan had done his part, Ben entered the enclosure, pulling the gate closed behind him. He caught all the buggers and stuffed them into the coop to prevent more escapes. The run was useless. The wire sagged so low, even chickens with clipped wings could probably hop over it.</p><p>After securing the door, he exited the run. He looked at Sissy. &#x201c;How many chickens do you have? I saw at least fifty on the street.&#x201d;</p><p>In a small voice, she said, &#x201c;Eighty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eighty?&#x201d; Ben studied the structure. &#x201c;That coop isn&#x2019;t big enough for eighty grown birds. Twenty, maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>She pushed tendrils of dark hair from her brow. &#x201c;It seemed a lot bigger when they were small. I want to increase my breakfast business, and since a lot of my customers are farmers, I thought.&#x201d; She flapped a limp hand. &#x201c;Well, you know. They dislike commercially grown eggs. So I took courses online and passed a test so I&#x2019;d be legal to raise layers and sell eggs. I even know how to grade them for size.&#x201d;</p><p>In other words, she knew a lot of useless stuff about chickens and nothing practical. &#x201c;And you think your breakfast crowd will go through eighty eggs a day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a mortality rate with chicks.&#x201d; She pushed her fingers through her hair, making it spike in all directions. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember the percentage, but I ordered plenty of chicks just in case some of them didn&#x2019;t make it.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked exhausted. Even worse, an expression of utter defeat played over her face.</p><p>&#x201c;But then nobody died!&#x201d; Her tone was laced with frustration. A horrified expression flashed in her eyes. &#x201c;Not that I wanted anybody to die.&#x201d; She dropped her hand from her hair to press it over her heart. &#x201c;I love them. They were such cute babies. I kept them in troughs in my bedroom under heat lights like they tell you to do. And then they got pasty butt, and I had to wash all their bums every night.&#x201d; She gave him an imploring look. &#x201c;They became my pets.&#x201d;</p><p>He tried to imagine washing the encrusted butts of eighty chicks every night after a hard day&#x2019;s work. As for loving chickens, they were just ...</p></p><h2>The Message New Testament (Mass Paper, Green): The New Testament in Contemporary Language (Experiencing God)</h2><p><b>Born a King.

One of the most striking features of the New Testament is that it was written in the street language of the day&#x2013;&#x2013;the idiom of the playground and marketplace, not the formal, lofty language of government decrees and historical documents.

He had discovered that when you simplify your investment decisions, you end up getting better returns. As a bonus, you gain more time for family, friends, and other pursuits.<br><br><i>The Coffeehouse Investor </i>explains why we should stop thinking about top-rated stocks and mutual funds, shifts in interest rates, and predictions for the economy. Stop trying to beat the stock market average, which few &#x201c;experts&#x201d; ever do. Instead, just remember three simple principles: Don&#x2019;t put all your eggs in one basket. There&#x2019;s no such thing as a free lunch. And save for a rainy day.<br><br>By focusing more on your passions and creativity and less on the daily ups and downs, you will actually build more wealth&#x2014;and improve the quality of your life at the same time.</p><p><b>Bill Schultheis</b> is a partner and fee-only financial advisor with Soundmark Wealth Management and a former broker for Smith Barney. The first editon of <i>The Coffeehouse Investor</i> was published in 1998, and he has lectured and led seminars about it since. He lives in Kirkland, Washington.This&nbsp;little how-to-invest book,&nbsp;which elegantly summarizes our common worries about how to build wealth, was initially published 11 years ago. This updated, revised, and revamped edition&nbsp;stands the test of time&#x2014;and of updating. Seattle-based&nbsp;Schultheis states his three principles of investing&#x2014;allocate assets, approximate stock-market average, and save&#x2014;then proceeds to expand and expound with personal stories and provocative questions. When is enough enough? What&#x2019;s behind this Wall Street obsession to beat the market? Why do we need to lead a penny-pinching life today for a high retirement style tomorrow? Forget the complicated formulas, the diversity of spreadsheets. Concentrate instead, he advises, on understanding your burn rate, the meaning of diversification, and the value of being on&nbsp;financial autopilot. Like his peers (Suze Orman et al.), the author exposes two myths: &#x201c;no load&#x201d; mutual funds and&nbsp;&#x201c;great companies make great investments.&#x201d; All in all, solid and comfortable investment counsel that will help balance (and, eventually, grow) your balance sheet.

Can you trust the information coming from Washington, the media, and the Internet?This classic work on critical thinking uses a novel approach to teach the basics of informal logic. On the assumption that &#34;it takes one to know one,&#34; the authors have written the book from the point of view of someone who wishes to deceive, mislead, or manipulate others. Having mastered the art of deception, readers will then be able to detect the misuse or abuse of logic when they encounter it in others -- whether in a heated political debate or while trying to evaluate the claims of a persuasive sales person. Using a host of real-world examples, the authors show you how to win an argument, defend a case, recognize a fallacy, see through deception, persuade a skeptic, and turn defeat into victory. Whether you&#39;re evaluating a social media rumor or you just want to become more adept at making your points and analyzing others&#39; arguments, The Art of Deception--now with an updated preface--will give you the intellectual tools to become a more effective thinker and speaker. Helpful exercises and discussion questions are also included.</p><p><b>&nbsp;<b>Nicholas Capaldi, PhD</b>,</b> holds the Legendre-Soul� Distinguished Scholar Chair in Business Ethics at Loyola University of New Orleans.

After more than sixty years of service as a nurse, she had helped to make nursing an honorable profession, left behind safer, cleaner hospitals, and saved countless lives.</p></p><p><p>Shannon Zemlicka has written books for young readers about Pocahontas, Neil Armstrong, Florence Nightingale, mallard ducks, and many other topics. She lives with her cat and her dog in Arizona. When she isn't writing, she likes to explore the desert and see how many of its plants and animals she can name.</p>Grade 1-3-A biography of the 19th-century British woman who helped make nursing an important profession. In her time, this was a job done by untrained, lower-class women. Over time, in spite of the disapproval of her upper-class family, she studied, visited, and researched hospitals and nursing schools, and became famous as a nurse during Britain's Crimean War in 1854. Her training school for nurses set a high standard that vastly improved health conditions. The en-gaging text is written in a lively style without resorting to fictionalized dialogue. The illustrations are of a much higher quality than is often seen in this type of series offering. The only problem with the book lies in its complete lack of background material and documentation. While the information seems accurate based on comparison to other Nightingale biographies, it would have been helpful to know what sources the author consulted.<br><i>Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Video Poker Edge, Second Edition: How to Play Smart and Bet Right</h2><p><p>Although most people believe that winning in casinos is a matter of luck, video poker actually gives you an opportunity to make decisions. The problem is that most people simply don&#x2019;t know how to make smart playing moves&#x2015;or they didn&#x2019;t until now. In this book, author and gambling expert Linda Boyd offers a user-friendly guide that helps you gain the winning edge over video poker machines.</p> <p><strong><em>The Video Poker Edge&nbsp;</em></strong>first explains the basics of video poker, and introduces you to eight common video poker games that pay well and are easy to play. For each recommended game, you&#x2019;ll learn the correct response to every common hand you may be dealt. The author even provides handy strategy cards that can be removed from the book and taken along to the casino for reference.</p></p><p><i> </i><p><i>Linda Boyd </i>spent many years as a mathematics educator&#x2015;a career that proved valuable in helping her design the statistical tactics included in this book, and present them in a way that is easy to understand even for the &#x201c;mathematically challenged.&#x201d; After years of playing blackjack and live poker, Ms. Boyd turned to the more profitable game of video poker. </p>Former math teacher Boyd's guide to winning bucketfuls of change is not for the casual casino-goer: readers will come across sentences like "the mathematically correct way to play any dealt hand is based on the stated payout table in conjunction with statistical probabilities"; be required to keep straight variances, expected returns and expected values (some are percentages; some are currency equivalents); and learn how to read seemingly cryptic charts before sinking their teeth into the meat of Boyd's strategies. But, for the left-brained set, Boyd's book is a boon: she excels in breaking down which hands to play, which types of video poker games offer better chances of payouts for large and small bankrolls, betting strategies and the different types of casinos and games readers can expect to find across the country. Readers who already know their way around a Harrah's will want to skip the sections dealing with gambling addiction, budgets and casino etiquette and cut to the discreetly pocketable payout charts and the approximately 40 pages Boyd dedicates to strategy.

The yellow awning was gone, but &#x201c;Elaine&#x2019;s&#x201d; was still painted on the darkened windows. A film of soap obscured the interior, but Stone found a bare spot and put his hands up to shield from the glare. What he saw was, in short, nothing.</p><p>The book jackets, photographs, and posters that had adorned the walls for forty-seven years were gone. The bar and mirrors behind it were still there, but there were no stools. The dining room contained no tables or chairs and no blue-checkered tablecloths. The two old pay phones still hung on the wall near the cashier&#x2019;s stand at the bar; they had always been the only phones in the place.</p><p>For a tiny moment Stone could hear the babble of a crowded room, chairs scraping, people calling the length of the room to say hello to a friend. Then a passing bus obliterated the sounds and returned Stone to the present. He got back into the cab and gave the driver his home address.</p><p>His cell phone buzzed at his belt. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dino. Where are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At Elaine&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>A brief silence, then: &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;The memory is better than the reality. Have you had dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was just thinking about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Viv?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s working.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come over and I&#x2019;ll make you some pasta.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You, yourself?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me, myself. I can cook, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was a rumor, but I never believed it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fifteen minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Oh, how are we dressing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unarmed,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m always armed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you can check your gun at the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How late is Viv working?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Until ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell her to come over after, and I&#x2019;ll save her something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see if she&#x2019;s brave enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See ya.&#x201d; Stone hung up.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>At home, he shucked off his jacket in the kitchen and checked the fridge. It was stuffed, as usual. Helene was an overshopper, and she liked to be ready for anything.</p><p>Stone found some Italian sausages, some mushrooms, some broccoli rabe, and some garlic. He sliced the sausages and tossed them into a skillet with a little olive oil, and they began to sizzle. He ran some water into a pot and put it on to boil for the pasta. He found some ziti in a cupboard and tossed it into the boiling water, then he chopped some onion and the garlic and tossed them into the pan with the sausages, followed by the mushrooms and rabe.</p><p>Dino came into the kitchen and tossed his coat on a chair. &#x201c;Jesus, that smells pretty good,&#x201d; he admitted.</p><p>&#x201c;Be ready in ten, fifteen minutes,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Pour us a drink.&#x201d;</p><p>Dino went to the kitchen bar, filled a pair of glasses with ice, then filled one with his usual Johnnie Walker Black scotch and the other with Stone&#x2019;s Knob Creek bourbon, then handed it to Stone. &#x201c;Okay, what was the place like?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bereft of all humankind and Elaine. Bereft of everything, come to that.&#x201d; The contents of the place had been sold at auction, along with Elaine&#x2019;s personal effects. Stone had bid on some books but didn&#x2019;t get them.</p><p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Dino said, taking a bite of his scotch, &#x201c;I think she&#x2019;d be happy that we can&#x2019;t find a new place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t that mean-spirited,&#x201d; Stone pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;She was about other joints. I&#x2019;m still afraid to go to Elio&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Elio was a former Elaine&#x2019;s headwaiter who had opened his own restaurant a couple of blocks down Second Avenue.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, me too. I only went once, just to say hello to Elio, but I never let her find out. She would have stabbed me with a fork.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or worse.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone found a hunk of Parmigianino-Reggiano in the fridge and dug the grater out of a drawer. He drained the pasta, forked some onto two plates, dumped some sausage onto the plates and grated a lot of the cheese over them, then he set them on the table and got a bottle of Amarone out of the wine closet and opened it. &#x201c;Sit yourself down,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Dino did, and they both ate hungrily.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>When Viv showed up, they hadn&#x2019;t even cleared the table; they were just sitting there, drinking and talking.</p><p>&#x201c;Just like Elaine&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Viv said. &#x201c;Without Elaine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Jasmine Shazaz sat in a car parked in Mount Street, London, with a cell phone in her hand. She watched as, fifty yards away, a government Jaguar pulled up in front of the Connaught Hotel and stopped. A man in a dark suit waved the uniformed doorman out of the way as he reached for the car&#x2019;s rear door, then opened it himself. Another man Jasmine recognized from newspapers and television as a high government official left the hotel and walked toward the open car door, got in and hipped his way across the seat to the left side.</p><p>The Special Branch detective, who had been holding the door open, got in behind him and closed the door. The car moved a few feet to Mount Street, the driver looked both ways, then turned left.</p><p>Jasmine pressed the phone button on her smartphone, chose a number, and looked out her windscreen. It would take three seconds to connect the call. She pressed the button. &#x201c;Three, two, one,&#x201d; she counted, and as she spoke the word &#x201c;zero,&#x201d; the glass front of the Porsche dealer&#x2019;s building at the bottom of Mount Street blew outward, followed by a large ball of flame.</p><p>The explosion rocked her car and enveloped the government Jaguar, which was directly in front of the Porsche dealer. The car took the full force of the explosion and was lifted off the pavement, rolling over. The gas tank exploded, creating a secondary ball of flame. The job was done.</p><p>Jasmine put her car in gear and, ignoring the broken glass and small rubble on the hood of her car, made a U-turn from her parking space, drove up to South Audley Street, crossed it, then a block later turned left into Park Lane. Sixty seconds later she was in Hyde Park, and five minutes after that she took a seat at the Serpentine Restaurant in the park and perused the menu. Her lunch date arrived a moment later and sat down.</p><p>&#x201c;I believe there was some sort of explosion over around Berkeley Square,&#x201d; he said, in perfect, upper-class English, though his appearance was Mediterranean, perhaps even Middle Eastern.</p><p>&#x201c;That must be why we&#x2019;re hearing all those fire engines and police cars,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if there&#x2019;s any news,&#x201d; he said, taking a smartphone from his jacket pocket and switching it on. A moment later they were watching ITV News as a slide appeared. &#x201c;Breaking News,&#x201d; it said.</p><p>A young woman, hastily arranging her skirt, gazed into the camera, then read from a sheet of paper in her hand. &#x201c;ITV News has a reliable report that some sort of bomb has gone off in Mayfair, perhaps in Mount Street. Our reporter, Jason Banks, has just arrived at the scene. Jason?&#x201d;</p><p>The camera jerked about, then stabilized. A man was clipping a microphone to his lapel, then he looked up and saw the camera. &#x201c;Good afternoon, Jane,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m standing a few yards from the northwest corner of Berkeley Square.&#x201d; He looked over his shoulder, and the camera zoomed in past him. &#x201c;As you can see, there has been a very large explosion up there, and it appears that the location was the building housing the Porsche sports car dealership. The front of the building has disappeared, and the fire brigade has just arrived on the scene and are connecting their hose pipes as we speak. The events have only just occurred&#x2014;I and my crew were on the other side of the square, interviewing a police spokesman about a robbery that occurred in Bruton Place a little over an hour ago. The policeman we were interviewing immediately called New Scotland Yard and reported the explosion, then ran toward the burning building. We moved our equipment as quickly as we could, and this is as close as we could get.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jason,&#x201d; the anchor said, holding a finger to an ear, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re just getting a report from a Westminster correspondent that the foreign secretary is lunching at the Connaught Hotel, about fifty meters up the street from the blast location, and we have a unit on the way there to interview him and see if we can get any further information.&#x201d;</p><p>The camera went back to Jason Banks. He was moving up the street to get closer to the burning building. &#x201c;Jane, we&#x2019;ve been able to get a few yards closer, and if our camera can zoom in on that burning motorcar sitting on top of two other cars . . . Zoom in on it, damn you!&#x201d; The camera zoomed in on the burning car. &#x201c;That was, until a few moments ago, a Jaguar motorcar, and as you can see, the front number plate begins with the letters FO, identifying it as a government vehicle assigned to the Foreign Office. We can only hope that is a horrible coincidence and that the foreign secretary is still enjoying his after-lunch port at the Connaught.&#x201d;</p><p>A police car with its lights and siren on came close to running down Jason Banks as it raced toward the burning vehicle. &#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; the reporter yelled. &#x201c;That was close. Let me see if I can get a word.&#x201d; He began jogging toward the police car, which had stopped a few yards away and was disgorging two high-ranking police officers, judging from their insignia.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me, Inspector,&#x201d; Banks said, thrusting a microphone at one of them, &#x201c;but does that number plate on that Jaguar belong to the foreign secretary?&#x201d;</p><p>The response to his shouted question was a stout forearm across the face, nearly causing him to eat his microphone. &#x201c;Get out of the way, you bloody fool!&#x201d; the officer yelled.</p><p>Banks fell back, nursing his lips with the back of his hand. &#x201c;As you can see, Jane, the inspector is in no mood to chat. Perhaps you can get a confirmation on this number plate.&#x201d; He began reading the letters and numbers.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Jason, we&#x2019;ll do that,&#x201d; the anchor said, scribbling down the numbers, then ripping a sheet off a pad and throwing it at someone off camera. &#x201c;Run that number down!&#x201d; she shouted at the person, then she recovered herself. &#x201c;If you are just joining us, what we know so far is . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The man switched off his smartphone. &#x201c;I think we can order lunch now,&#x201d; he said to Jasmine, while beckoning a waiter.</p><p>&#x201c;Order me the Dover sole,&#x201d; Jasmine said. &#x201c;And I think, perhaps, a bottle of champagne would be in order.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly Barker, assistant director of Central Intelligence, took her seat at the table in the conference room of her boss, Katharine Rule Lee, the director of Central Intelligence. She was well rested after a couple of days off following a meeting between the presidents of the United States and Mexico, which she had attended in company with the director.</p><p>The final seats at the table were filled at fifteen seconds before nine o&#x2019;clock, according to the GPS-controlled clock on the wall, and at the stroke of nine, the director entered the room and sat down.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; Kate Lee said. &#x201c;Thank you for coming. Holly, what&#x2019;s on our agenda for this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Director,&#x201d; Holly replied. &#x201c;DDO Lance Cabot has three reports from foreign stations, to start us off.&#x201d; She nodded at Lance.</p><p>Cabot shuffled some papers. &#x201c;Our station in Lagos, Nigeria, was the target of a Molotov cocktail earlier today. The bottle shattered on the wrought-iron fence, and only slightly splashed the facade of the building. A Marine guard extinguished the flame almost immediately. No one has, as yet, claimed credit, but we suspect either an antigovernment insurgent group or, perhaps, the government itself. Take your pick.&#x201d; He set aside a sheet of paper, then continued. &#x201c;We have penetrated the administrative offices of an army base in . . .&#x201d; Lance stopped as a middle-aged woman walked behind him, tapped him on the shoulder, and placed a sheet of paper in front of him. He read it, then looked up.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it, Lance?&#x201d; Kate asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Tom Riley, London station chief, is on the phone with something important.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate reached for the phone near her and pressed the line button and the speaker control. &#x201c;Good morning, Tom. We are assembled at the regular morning briefing. Everyone is here. What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;</p><p>A large flat-screen monitor flickered to life and revealed a man in his late forties with an iron-gray, old-fashioned crew cut. &#x201c;Good morning, Director, everybody. Local TV news is running a breaking news report of a large explosion at a Porsche dealership just off Berkeley Square. One of our people was lunching at the Connaught and saw the foreign secretary leave the dining room perhaps three minutes earlier. A Jaguar that might well be his official car was passing the dealership when the explosion took place, and anyone inside the car is now dead. We&#x2019;re awaiting the running of the plate number, which begins with FO, indicating a Foreign Office vehicle.&#x201d; News footage of a burning car filled the screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Tom,&#x201d; Kate said, &#x201c;if the foreign secretary was in the car, do you have an opinion as to whether this was intended as an attack on him or if he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that would be much too large a coincidence to be credible,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;Hang on, I&#x2019;ve just had confirmation that the number plate belonged to the foreign secretary&#x2019;s car, and our own man reports seeing the man get into the car in front of the Connaught.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any thoughts on the perpetrators?&#x201d; Kate asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Too many possibilities to make an educated guess at this point, but we&#x2019;re on it, and we have good sources at New Scotland Yard, so we should have an idea soon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything else, Tom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not at this time, Director.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep us posted, then.&#x201d; She pressed the button, and the screen went dark. &#x201c;Not every day we have the assassination of a cabinet member in a major European ally,&#x201d; she said to the table at large. &#x201c;Lance? Anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing that would have led us to anticipate such an event, Director,&#x201d; Cabot replied. &#x201c;Not a peep. I find it interesting that the perpetrators decided to take out a building and God knows who and what else at a corner of London&#x2019;s most famous square, in an effort to take out one man. I think there&#x2019;s a statement there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Director,&#x201d; Holly said, &#x201c;given the timing, there must have been an operative on or near the site to set off the explosion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good point, Holly,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;Will you call Tom back when we&#x2019;re done and ask him to get every possible angle of surveillance footage from New Scotland Yard? London has thousands of these cameras. I&#x2019;m sure Special Branch is already reviewing the recording, but we might be able to spot somebody not in their files.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Director,&#x201d; Holly said, making a note. As she did, Holly had a thought, but it was too soon to bring it up, and certainly not in this meeting.</p><p>&#x201c;Did I detect something just now, Holly? An idea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a wild guess, Director. I&#x2019;d like to run it down a little before I make an ass of myself.&#x201d;</p><p>That gained a chuckle from the dozen men and women present.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, go on, Holly, I&#x2019;d like a view into your frontal lobe. Entertain us.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly shrugged. &#x201c;If you insist, Director. You will recall that, last week, a London asset of ours and his brother were involved in planting bombs at an L.A. location. They are both dead now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For which we can thank the appropriate person at this table,&#x201d; Kate said.</p><p>Lance lifted...</p></p><h2>The Basics of Process Improvement</h2><p><p>Unlike other books that promote a specific process and performance improvement discipline, this book shows organizations how to achieve success by fixing basic operational issues and problems using a broad and wide-sweeping process-based toolkit.

Maybe some were as simple as cuddling with your child or playing peek-a-boo. Perhaps some were as far-reaching as your child&#x2019;s high school graduation or wedding day. <br>But then your child was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. <br>You may have felt that many doors were suddenly closed to the child you love because this diagnosis is often accompanied by a long list of dire predictions. <br>Your child will never talk. <br>Your child will never have friends. <br>Your child will never hold your hand. <br>Your child will never have a job or get married. <br>Perhaps even: your child will never love you. <br>You may have been told to discard many of those hopes and dreams and be &#x201c;realistic&#x201d; in the face of your child&#x2019;s diagnosis. Certainly, there are many, many parents who have heard the pronouncement: &#x201c;Autism is a lifelong condition.&#x201d; <br>No one could fault you for feeling grief-stricken, scared, or even angry. You have just been told all of the things your child will never accomplish&#x2014;as if it had been decided ahead of time. But before reading any further, it is crucial that you understand this: you don&#x2019;t have to accept the limits placed upon your child. <br>Your child has the capacity for learning and communicating, for experiencing real happiness, and developing warm, loving, and satisfying relationships. Your son or daughter can learn to enjoy affection, play a game, and laugh at something silly. He or she can learn to savor the experience of being hugged or held by you. That moment when your child spontaneously looks into your eyes with genuine joy and connection&#x2014;that is something you can have, not just for a fleeting second but on a sustained basis. Do you ever imagine your child playing Little League, joining you on a bike ride, going on a skiing trip with you, playing with other kids at the park, or doing something in the future such as going to college? These events are possible. Children on the autism spectrum are capable of great change, including recovery. <br>Who am I to tell you this? I&#x2019;m someone who&#x2019;s been there&#x2014;not where <i>you</i> are, but where <i>your child</i> is. <br>I used to be autistic. <br>I know, I know. That one&#x2019;s a bit hard to digest. You don&#x2019;t often find &#x201c;used to be&#x201d; and &#x201c;autistic&#x201d; in the same sentence. This is truly unfortunate, because it points to the intense pessimism and utter hopelessness with which autism is viewed by the people doing the diagnosing. Do you know what my chances of recovery were, according the specialists assessing me? <br>Zero percent. <br>That&#x2019;s right: 0%. <br>Here&#x2019;s what happened. <br>MY STORY <br>When I was a young boy, my parents (authors and teachers Barry Neil Kaufman and Samahria Lyte Kaufman) saw that I was developing very differently from my two older sisters. I cried incessantly and inconsolably. When I was picked up, I let my arms dangle loosely at my sides. <br>Before my first birthday, I suffered a severe ear and throat infection, compounded by a violent allergic reaction to the antibiotics prescribed. My life briefly hung in the balance. After a battery of hearing tests, my parents were told that I appeared deaf. As months passed, I seemed increasingly cut off, spiraling ever deeper into my own world. <br>I stopped responding to my name. <br>I ceased making eye contact. <br>I appeared alternately repulsed by and oblivious to the sights and sounds around me. <br>I appeared deaf to a loud noise right next to me and then mesmerized by an almost inaudible whisper in the next room. <br>I lost all interest in other people, but I would remain transfixed by inanimate objects, staring at a pen, a mark on the wall, even my own hands, for long periods of time. <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to be touched or held. <br>I spoke not a word (nor did I cry, yell, point, or do anything to communicate my wishes), displaying a total muteness that stood in sharp contrast to my earlier crying marathons. <br>And then something startling: I became fascinated with the simplest of repetitive activities, spinning plates on their edges for hours on the floor, rocking back and forth, flapping my hands in front of my face. <br>As my condition worsened, my parents raced from specialist to specialist, trying to find out what was wrong. Tests. Tapping pencils. Shaking heads. More tests. (Keep in mind that, in 1973, the year I was born, autism was much less common than it is now, affecting one out of every five thousand children. The latest study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) puts the incidence of autism at one out of every fifty children.) Soon I was diagnosed as severely autistic. My parents were informed that my IQ was less than 30. <br>What can feel like a devastating diagnosis is not really due to the autism diagnosis itself. The devastation comes primarily from the <i>prognosis</i>&#x2014;all the things parents are told that their child will not do and cannot accomplish. <br>Like many parents today, my parents were told that the prognosis was certain. I would never speak or communicate in any meaningful way. I would never prefer people over objects. I would never emerge from my solitary world and be &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; Moreover, I would never go to college, have a career, or play baseball. I would never fall in love, drive a car, or write a poem. I might, one day, be able to dress myself or eat with utensils, but that was the ceiling of my possibilities. <br>My parents, seeking solutions, were given only grim pronouncements. They searched for a light at the end of the tunnel and were given only dark predictions. Over and over again, it was drilled into my parents&#x2019; heads: autism is a lifelong condition. The specialists explained that, when I got older, my parents would need to look into permanent institutionalization so that I could be properly looked after. <br>I am still astounded at what my mother and father chose to do in the face of such a damning verdict. They didn&#x2019;t believe what they were told. They didn&#x2019;t write me off. Instead, they turned their backs on all the dire prognoses. My parents looked at me and saw possibilities, not deficiencies. Instead of looking at me with fear, they viewed me with wonder. <br>And so they began an experiment. They began by seeking to create an environment where I felt truly safe. They didn&#x2019;t push me. They didn&#x2019;t try to change my behaviors. They sought first to understand me. Think about this for a moment. How often do we really do this&#x2014;with <i>anyone</i>? People behave in ways we don&#x2019;t understand all the time. For most of us, our knee-jerk response is to try to get that person to change&#x2014;whether that person is our partner, our friend, a store clerk, an employee, our parent, or, indeed, our child. When do we ever <i>begin</i> our response by truly seeking to understand without pushing, to provide the other person with an experience of safety and caring without trying to get him or her to change? How amazing that my parents began from this most kind and useful place. <br>Having heard thousands of parents tell me about their experiences with their children&#x2019;s diagnosis and treatment, how they were given a laundry list of things &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; with their child, this description from the opening page of my father&#x2019;s book <i>Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues</i> touches me deeply: <br>His little hands hold the plate delicately as his eyes survey its smooth perimeter. His mouth curls in delight. He is setting the stage. This is his moment, as was the last and each before. This is the beginning of his entry into the solitude that has become his world. Slowly, with a masterful hand, he places the edge of the plate on the floor, sets his body in a comfortable and balanced position, and snaps his wrist with great expertise. The plate begins to spin with dazzling perfection. It revolves on itself as if set in motion by some exacting machine. And it was. <br>This is not an isolated act, not a mere aspect of some childhood fantasy. It is a conscious and delicately skilled activity performed by a very little boy for a very great and expectant audience&#x2014;himself. <br>As the plate moves swiftly, spinning hypnotically on its edge, the little boy bends over it and stares squarely into its motion. Homage to himself, to the plate. For a moment, the boy&#x2019;s body betrays a just perceptible movement similar to the plate&#x2019;s. For a moment, the little boy and his spinning creation become one. His eyes sparkle. He swoons in the playland that is himself. Alive. Alive. <br>Raun Kahlil&#x2014;a little man occupying the edge of the universe. <br>Before this time, this every moment, we had always been in awe of Raun, our notably special child. We sometimes referred to him as &#x201c;brain-blessed.&#x201d; He had always seemed to be riding the high of his own happiness. Highly evolved. Seldom did he cry or utter tones of discomfort. In almost every way, his contentment and solitude seemed to suggest a profound inner peace. He was a seventeen-month-old Buddha contemplating another dimension. <br>A little boy set adrift on the circulation of his own system. Encapsulated behind an invisible but seemingly impenetrable wall. Soon he would be labeled. A tragedy. Unreachable. Bizarre. Statistically, he would fall into a category reserved for all those we see as hopeless&nbsp;&#x2026; unapproachable&nbsp;&#x2026; irreversible. For us the question: could we kiss the ground that others had cursed? <br>Coming from this reverential vantage point, my parents asked themselves what they could do to understand me and my world. The answer began with something that my mother did. She wanted to understand me&#x2014;and also to show me that she accepted me as I was. That I didn&#x2019;t have to change to be loved. <br>So she began to join me in my repetitive, supposedly autistic behaviors. I would sit on the floor and rock&nbsp;&#x2026; and she would rock with me. I would spin a plate on its edge&nbsp;&#x2026; and she would spin her own plate next to mine. I would flap my hands in front of my face&nbsp;&#x2026; and she would flap with me. <br>My parents so respected me that they focused totally on what <i>my</i> experience was&#x2014;not on whether I looked strange or different to other people. <br>Hour after hour&nbsp;&#x2026; day after day&nbsp;&#x2026; month after month, my mother waited. Patiently, my parents waited. <br>Every once in a while, and only while &#x201c;joining,&#x201d; as my parents came to call this true participation in my interests and activities, I glanced at my mother. I smiled at her. I grazed her with the tips of my fingers. <br>And as my parents began to truly understand my world, as they communicated in a thousand different ways, over and over again, that I was safe, that I was loved, that I was accepted, something astonishing happened. A connection began to form. Slowly, carefully, I began to peek out from behind the veil of my special world. Tentatively, I began to join them in theirs. <br>As my mother spent hours upon hours on the floor working with me, she made herself my friend in my world. In so doing, a bond of trust evolved. She cherished and celebrated every look, every smile, every moment of connection for which my parents had waited so long. She cheered me on with every small step. <br>As my relationship with my parents and the world of people strengthened, my mom and dad continued to build an entire program of therapy around me. They helped me to increase my social connection to them and to others, encouraging me to play with them, to look at them, to laugh with them, to take their hands. They constructed interactive games based upon my burgeoning interests, such as animals and airplanes. At every turn, they accomplished this with a deep caring, encouragement, and support&#x2014;never pushing, always inviting. <br>Can you imagine it? They embarked on this experimental journey after hearing nothing but hopeless predictions for me. They continued to reach out to me when I gave them nothing in return. <br>And they persevered in the face of consistent criticism. Learned professionals told my parents that their &#x201c;joining&#x201d; would reinforce and increase my &#x201c;inappropriate autistic behaviors.&#x201d; These professionals chastised my parents for doing the opposite of the behavior modification techniques they recommended&#x2014;and for having &#x201c;false hope,&#x201d; for putting their time into an unproven (and just created) approach that &#x201c;had no hope of succeeding.&#x201d; Family members expressed grave doubts and concerns that my parents were &#x201c;doing their own thing&#x201d; and not leaving my treatment in the hands of professionals who &#x201c;knew best.&#x201d; <br>Remember, too, that, in those days, the world of autism treatment was a barren wasteland. There were no nightly news stories waxing on about the latest treatments or detailing the lives of families with children on the spectrum. There was no Autism Awareness Month. <br>My parents witnessed children being jolted with electric shocks, tied to chairs, placed in dark prison-like rooms, held down&#x2014;and were told that this was progress, the best modern medicine had to offer. <br>To help me, they had to walk in the opposite direction, alone. Without any support, they supported me. They worked and waited. They persisted and persevered. Not knowing what the future held, not requiring my reciprocation of their love, care, smiles, and cheers, they gave me every chance. <br>For three and a half years, they worked with me, painstakingly building a bridge from my world to theirs. <br>And it all paid off. <br>I recovered completely from my autism without any trace of my former condition. (Go to www.autismbreakthrough.com/chapter1 to see some childhood photos of me and my parents.) The years of work, the late nights, the persevering in the face of ongoing criticism, the love and dedication&#x2014;it bore the kind of fruit it was never supposed to bear. It produced the outcome it was never supposed to produce. And I&#x2019;ve lived the life I was never supposed to live. <br>THE CREATION OF THE AUTISM TREATMENT CENTER OF AMERICA <br>My parents developed this innovative, home-based, child-centered autism treatment program because of their very personal experiences entering my world. At the same time, the method they created was based upon what autism actually is&#x2014;a difficulty connecting and bonding with others&#x2014;rather than how autism is typically treated&#x2014;as a problem of inappropriate behavior that must be extinguished, altered, and retrained. <br>They called their approach The Son-Rise Program. <br>There were several factors that made their approach unique. First, it was created by parents. That alone was a gigantic departure from the doctor/professional/lab-created norm. Second, my parents began with the premise that children on the autism spectrum are capable of limitless growth. Third, they started by joining me in my world rather than forcing me to conform to theirs. Fourth, they used motivation, rather than repetition, as the doorway to learning. Moreover, they focused on having a nonjudgmental and welcoming attitude with me, seeing that my responsiveness was largely dependent on the attitudes and emotions of the people working with me. And, finally, unlike every other treatment they saw, my parents prioritized human interaction over academics and tasks such as naming colors, adding numbers, and brushing teeth. <br>But until my recovery was complete, none of these concepts had spread beyond the walls of our house. Until my father wrote a book about it. <br>Shortly after my recovery in the late 1970s, my father wrote a best-selling book recounting our story entitled <i>Son-Rise</i>&#x2014;now updated as <i>Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues</i>.

For business travelers there are key sections on the economy and vital insights into the general business culture. The third-largest country in Latin America, Mexico is hugely diverse, having both rural areas where time seems to have stood still and manic urban centers like Mexico City, one of the most densely populated and exciting cities in the world. Famed for its well-preserved archaeological sites, cobblestoned colonial towns, and beautiful beaches, it is a major magnet for tourists. Mexico also has a name as a creative powerhouse in the region, with world-renowned artists such as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, a cinema industry that has been producing award-winning movies since the Golden Age of the 1940s, and a literary scene second to none in Latin America.</p><p><b>Russell Maddicks</b> is an award-winning BBC-trained journalist, translator, and travel writer.

Are Russian propaganda or "Fake news" entrepreneurs on Facebook undermining our sense of a shared reality? A conventional wisdom has emerged since the election of Donald Trump in 2016 that new technologies and their manipulation by foreign actors played a decisive role in his victory and are responsible for the sense of a "post-truth" moment in which disinformation and propaganda thrives.<br><br><em>Network Propaganda</em> challenges that received wisdom through the most comprehensive study yet published on media coverage of American presidential politics from the start of the election cycle in April 2015 to the one year anniversary of the Trump presidency. Analysing millions of news stories together with Twitter and Facebook shares, broadcast television and YouTube, the book provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture of contemporary American political communications. Through data analysis and detailed qualitative case studies of coverage of immigration, Clinton scandals, and the Trump Russia investigation, the book finds that the right-wing media ecosystem operates fundamentally differently than the rest of the media environment. <br><br>The authors argue that longstanding institutional, political, and cultural patterns in American politics interacted with technological change since the 1970s to create a propaganda feedback loop in American conservative media. This dynamic has marginalized centre-right media and politicians, radicalized the right wing ecosystem, and rendered it susceptible to propaganda efforts, foreign and domestic. For readers outside the United States, the book offers a new perspective and methods for diagnosing the sources of, and potential solutions for, the perceived global crisis of democratic politics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Yochai Benkler</strong> is the Berkman Professor of Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, and faculty co-director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.<br><br><strong>Robert Faris</strong> is the Research Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. <br><br><strong>Hal Roberts</strong> is a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University.<br>There are a lot of books on networks, social media, propaganda, polarization and American politics. This is the best.<i>Cass Sunstein, Best Books of 2018, in Bloomberg</i><br><br>Liberals want facts; conservatives want their biases reinforced. Liberals embrace journalism; conservatives believe propaganda. In the more measured but still emphatic words of the authors, "the right-wing media ecosystem differs categorically from the rest of the media environment," and has been much more susceptible to "disinformation, lies and half-truths." [...] The book is not a work of media criticism but, rather, of data analysis--a study of millions of online stories, tweets, and Facebook-sharing data points. The authors' conclusion is that "something very different was happening in right-wing media than in centrist, center-left and left-wing media." [...] it was the feedback loop of right-wing quasi-journalism that had the most impact--and that hypothesis has profound implications not only for the study of the recent past but also for predictions about the not-so-distant future.<i>Jeffrey Toobin&nbsp;in&nbsp;The&nbsp;New Yorker</i><i></i><br><br>Benkler, Faris and Roberts weave their findings into a dense but readable narrative that draws on a wide array of political science studies.&nbsp;They conclude that restoration and reunification of the cleaved system of US public communication cannot begin without "a series of electoral defeats that would force such a transformation."<i>Michael Cornfield, associate professor of political management at the George Washington University, in The Guardian</i><i></i><i></i><i></i><br><br>"Network Propaganda," by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts [...] uses data to show convincingly that most of the disinformation circulating during the 2016 campaign was actually spread by the good old-fashioned right-wing American media: Breitbart and Fox News.<i>Annalisa Quinn in The New York Times Magazine</i><br><br>This long, complex, yet readable study of the American media ecosystem in the run-up to the 2016 election (as well as the year afterwards) demonstrates that the epistemic-closure problem has generated what the authors call an "epistemic crisis" for Americans in general. The book also shows that our efforts to understand current political division and disruptions simplistically--either in terms of negligent and arrogant platforms like Facebook, or in terms of Bond-villain malefactors like Cambridge Analytica or Russia's Internet Research Agency--are missing the forest for the trees. It's not that the social media platforms are wholly innocent, and it's not that the would-be warpers of voter behavior did nothing wrong (or had no effect). But the seeds of the unexpected outcomes in the 2016 U.S. elections, Network Propaganda argues, were planted decades earlier, with the rise of a right-wing media ecosystem that valued loyalty and confirmation of conservative (or "conservative") values and narratives over truth.<i>Mike Goodwin in techdirt</i></p><h2>This Is Not How It Ends</h2><p><p><b>From <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Rochelle B.

But I&#39;m very proud to say that since receiving this book, I&#39;ve also managed a hexagon! Yes, I&#39;m a long way short of a blanket, but it&#39;s a start. The book is 128 pages long, in full colour, and with excellent drawings of colour charts and photographs of the finished items. You can tell straight away this is a quality edition. It&#39;s a very easy book to understand, even for a complete beginner. Everything is explained- in terms I understood- and there are even conversions in the back for readers from other countries. There are recommended yarns and hook sizes, tips on how to join your motifs, as well as colour charts for 10 different projects. A sample motif for each blanket is written out- in the way a knitting pattern is- but also shown as a stitch diagram. I&#39;m sure everyone would be able to follow one set or the other. I&#39;m really enjoying getting back into crochet again. * Ellie Lane * A new book from a designer I admire, is always worth the wait.

So refreshing to read a book with projects for the established crocheter, eager to be challenged. There are 10 of Amanda&#39;s glorious blanket projects in this book. Each is made up of simple shaped motif and includes both stitch charts and written patterns, along with many variations of colour charts. In this way you are given a total of 30 project options to choose from. It is the colour charts that make this book stand out from similar books. Amanda has carefully planned and designed colour variations on her original blankets. I love this aspect of the book, because I enjoy stamping my own style on a pattern and will rarely reproduce someone else&#39;s work to the exact colour specifications. On a rainy day it was a joy to flick through, with a cup of coffee and notebook by my side. Future projects are in the planning... The beauty of these blankets is in the yarn choices. Independent yarn dyers and spinners are recommended along with handy details of where they can be purchased. The larger commercial yarn companies are also listed as an alternative. I do realise that making a blanket using yarn from independent companies would work out very expensively, but what a beautiful heirloom to hand down to our families...? So to sum up: this a book with 10 beautiful projects for a beginner crocheter to aspire to, and for a more experienced crocheter to make. The colour charts give you a further 20 pattern options. Construction information is included, is well written and very easy to understand.The charts are very handy and there is a small section explaining how to read a chart which I found useful. If you are looking for a Christmas present for a crochet fan, buy this! They will not be disappointed with it, and will probably love you forever. I also had the pleasure of seeing these blankets in real life at Yarndale recently. They are stunning! http://www.lazydaisyjones.com/2016/10/searchpress-rainbow-crochet-blankets-by.html * Lazy Daisy Jones * This book is a refreshing change from the norm. It doesn&#39;t want you to make exact copies of the blankets, it wants you to make your own design using the patterns. The book uses written patterns as well as charts and diagrams. The patterns are easy to follow and the colour charts give you so many. The whole point of the book really is colour. It&#39;s amazing how the different colours with the different designs create amazing blankets. Amanda uses 4 ply yarn so the designs are more detailed and more colours can be packed in. Each of the designs are so different from each other and I love the fact that quite a few aren&#39;t just rectangular. Amanda uses different shapes to create blankets that look unique. Working together with the different colours she uses create many beautiful designs. If you love to crochet blankets then this book really will fill your time. The only problem you might have is deciding which blanket to crochet first. * Crochet Addict UK * Issue 83 With an artist&#39;s eye for colour and shade, Amanda Perkins has put together a collection of ten glorious blanket designs, mixing patterns and tones to truly show-stopping effect. Our favourites include the purple hued Knot Garden and the beautiful rainbow Solstice, but any one would be a stunning addition to your home. Amanda recommends you work using yarn oddments left from other projects, and each pattern begins with a discussion of the colour palette and recommended brands. * Inside Crochet * A great book for those who are familiar with crochet and ready to start making blankets. I found the book easy to follow and there are lots of ideas and paterns inside to make your own blanket unique * Joanne Rudland * A great book for those who are familiar with crochet and ready to start making blankets. I found the book easy to follow and there are lots of ideas and paterns inside to make your own blanket unique * Emily Greentree * This is such a happy, joyous book. The front cover just about says it all. Amanda is a lady with a mission to create colour on a large scale. She wants to paint the whole world with a rainbow. Her blankets are not only practical, they are gorgeous. She certainly has an eye for colour combinations and if you struggle with colour, this would be a great book for you. Easy to follow squares make eye-catching blankets. You could mix and match. Fabulous alternative colourways, variety of yarns (4ply just use the yarn gauge to substitute), written instructions, charts, good photography and easy stitching make for addictive crochet. You&#39;ll see the blanket size, hook size, yarn type and notes at a glance. No particular yarn is given so as not to restrict your choice. Choose from 10 blankets. Creativity is encouraged to make your own blanket designs and this is not a how to crochet book, although step-by-step are given for the blocks. There are circles or triangles within the blocks, and Amanda has used the blocks creatively. Stitches used are mainly use just double and treble crochet. These blocks are easy to make on the go, whereas the kind of all-over pattern is hard to travel with, as you are taking a full-sized blanket on the go. Amanda recommends using scrap yarns to create the blankets. Grab some 4 ply and start crocheting. Practical, adaptable and colourful designs in one of the best crochet books on the market.

Hubert de Givenchy immortalized the Little Black Dress with a single opening scene in <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>. A red nylon jacket signaled to audiences that James Dean was a <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>. For more than a century, costume designers have left indelible impressions on moviegoers' minds. Yet until now, so little has been known about the designers themselves and their work to complement and enrich stories through fashion.<br> <i>Creating the Illusion</i> presents the history of fashion on film, showcasing not only classic moments from film favorites, but a host of untold stories about the creative talent working behind the scenes to dress the stars from the silent era to the present day. Among the book's sixty-five designer profiles are Clare West, Howard Greer, Adrian, Walter Plunkett, Travis Banton, Irene, Edith Head, Cecil Beaton, Bob Mackie, and Colleen Atwood. The designers' stories are set against the backdrop of Hollywood: how they collaborated with great movie stars and filmmakers; how they maneuvered within the studio system; and how they came to design clothing that remains iconic decades after its first appearance. The array of films discussed and showcased through photos spans more than one hundred years, from draping Rudolph Valentino in exotic "sheik" dress to the legendary costuming of <i>Gone with the Wind, Alfred Hitchcock</i> thrillers, <i>Bonnie and Clyde, Reservoir Dogs</i>, and beyond.<br> This gloriously illustrated volume includes candid photos of the designers at work, portraits and wardrobe tests of stars in costume, and designer sketches.

Based on Ignatian principles, the thirty-nine mediations are meant to help readers use their imagination to enter into the Gospel scene and experience the presence of Jesus. From Jesus baptism in the Jordan to his temptation in the desert and the wedding feast at Cana, Fr. Pacwa provides fascinating background information about the text, such as the geography of Palestine and Jewish customs and ideas. Then he asks a series of questions that are intended to lead readers into a deeper examination of their own life and mission in the world today.</p><p>Fr. Mitch Pacwa, SJ, is a popular host on the EWTN Catholic television network and founder and president of Ignatius Productions, a Catholic media production apostolate. A respected biblical scholar and speaker, he serves as senior fellow at the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology. He is fluent in twelve languages and has led more than fifty pilgrimages to holy sites around the world.This is vintage Fr. Pacwa guiding us, like his master St. Ignatius in a richly imaginative and prayerful reading of Gospel texts. This book provides a solid foundation of a truly biblical spirituality. --Scott Hahn, professor of theology, Franciscan University of Steubenville, and author of <i>Joy to the World: How Christ s Coming Changed Everything</i><br><br>Fr. Pacwa helps us encounter Jesus just as Peter, Andrew, and John did when he first stepped onto the public stage long ago. Through Biblical reflections and prayerful meditations, this book takes us back into the first-century world of Christ's day and deep into the Gospels so that we can encounter Jesus anew today in a way that shapes our lives. --Edward Sri, Augustine Institute professor of theology and author of <i>A Biblical Walk through the Mass</i><br><br>While we often look to the Gospels for answers, Fr. Mitch Pacwa shows us that we are also confronted with probing questions: What is Jesus calling me to do? What is he calling me to leave behind? What in me requires his healing touch?

Our room was the size of a postage stamp, while the bed was too high off the ground, all of which left me feeling like an awkward giant. It was obvious that the flaccid bacon on my dinnertime sandwich had been cooked the previous morning. And why were the knife and fork the size of airline flatware? Even though I&#x2019;m a positive person, it&#x2019;s very easy for little disappointments to bum me out. Nowadays, it&#x2019;s hard not to automatically home in on low hospitality standards. It&#x2019;s frustrating because everything I see is easily preventable. I have to force myself to blow these annoyances off&#x2014;otherwise, I&#x2019;d never be able to enjoy a dinner, or just about anything I do in my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, I am a bit cocky when it comes to guest standards, but not without justification: I have more than thirty-five years of experience working in every aspect of the hospitality business. I <i>know</i> hotels, restaurants, bars, dives, burger joints, and nightclubs are capable of best-of-class excellence. I wasn&#x2019;t always this sensitive&#x2014;standards didn&#x2019;t make it onto my radar until I was a few years into the business. I&#x2019;ll never forget walking through a major hotel with the vice president of product development for Hyatt International, Frank C. Ansel III. Youthful exuberance made me come off like a big shot even though I was nothing of the sort. We were holding a management and entrepreneurship seminar for the company&#x2019;s East Asia employees. The food and beverage director of the hotel knew we were coming, so he had spruced up the place. Everything at the hotel looked amazing to me, but twenty minutes into the walkthrough, Frank looked at his manager with obvious displeasure. I asked Frank why he was upset.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s doing things well because you look but you don&#x2019;t see,&#x201d; Frank said. He pulled me over to a table and pointed out that the service plates weren&#x2019;t turned the same way, nor was the flatware placed consistently at each setting. Frank nodded toward a waiter who was pouring out of the side of a pitcher instead of the spout&#x2014;a real no-no in table service. These are subtle things, but they demonstrated a lack of standards and attention to detail. When &#x201c;little&#x201d; things are off, it means more important standards are also probably lacking. That line, &#x201c;You look but you don&#x2019;t see,&#x201d; has stayed with me ever since. After that day, I have never been able to walk past a dirty carpet or a cracked wall without reacting. I notice everything. Businesses are defined by their details. Now, when I look, I see.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about this: Two people get dressed in the morning. One person throws on whatever clothes are available; the other takes the time to select an outfit and make sure it&#x2019;s clean, pressed, and put together. Who makes the better impression? The carefully dressed person is thought of as calmer, more powerful, smarter, and more thoughtful than the sloppy one. In an experiment to test perceptions and appearance, teaching assistants who wore formal clothes were perceived as more intelligent than those who dressed more casually. A Harvard study found that women who wore makeup were considered more competent and likable than their barefaced counterparts. (I love this kind of science because it has practical applications for business owners&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why I use a lot of it in <i>Bar Rescue</i> and in my work as a consultant.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lessons are as relevant for businesses as they are for individuals. In a joint study conducted by Cornell and Columbia Universities, consumers who encountered either a delay in being seated in a restaurant by a host or a delay in getting a check from their server evaluated <i>overall</i> service more negatively than customers who didn&#x2019;t experience those two specific delays. Maybe this seems like a no-brainer to you, but obviously many restaurants don&#x2019;t think enough about it, considering how long it often takes someone to seat you or to bring over the bill once you&#x2019;ve requested it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it. When a customer&#x2019;s expectations for your business don&#x2019;t match reality (e.g., &#x201c;They are slow when they should be faster, ergo they do not care about me or my time.&#x201d;), his or her perception is effected, oftentimes permanently. Shoddy business presentation and practices affect how much value a customer places on your brand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, your customers notice &#x201c;off&#x201d; stuff&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you? They (justifiably) believe that your less-than-stellar details are &#x201c;business as usual&#x201d; and therefore an accurate measure of your entire business. Generally, though, you won&#x2019;t hear that negative feedback because nine out of ten people who have a negative experience with a business don&#x2019;t mention problems (even on social media); they just never return. Pretty frightening statistic, isn&#x2019;t it? I doubt that&#x2019;s the reaction you&#x2019;re looking for.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me try this one out on you. When someone asks what you do for a living, how do you answer? Whatever it is, however you describe it, you&#x2019;ve probably got it wrong. That&#x2019;s because you aren&#x2019;t in the service, food, beverage, beauty, law, accounting, merchandising, retail, hospitality, sales, facilities, entertainment&#x2014;had enough?&#x2014;fashion, media, education, technology, or whatever other industry you define as your business. I believe you&#x2019;re in the <i>business of customer and employee reactions.</i> And I have four rules that govern that belief: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything we do is part of a process, never a result.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every business process, step, or communication must create a positive customer reaction each and every time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reaction <i>is</i> the product.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any business, no matter what it is, lives or dies by the customer reactions it creates. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My overarching philosophy is this: <i>all</i> successful business is about creating the right reactions in customers. The way you present yourself and your business, your curb or Web appeal, your logo, where you put your products or how you place your content, the color of your marketing pieces, price points, dress code&#x2014;everything you do in your business&#x2014;creates reactions. The best reactions always make the most money.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live to create employee and customer reactions. Whether you&#x2019;re in San Francisco, New York, or Exeter, New Hampshire, the product or &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; you use to get a reaction may differ, but the feelings perpetuated by the way you do business are universal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory of reactions is part of cultural anthropology&#x2014;it&#x2019;s in our DNA. The concept of creating a response is as primal as it gets, a constant that has existed throughout time and across cultures. The leader of an African tribe has the same dynamic set of management skills, confidence, and leadership ability as the head of a corporation in Cleveland. The priest who works hard on his Sunday sermon is not that different from the Saturday night DJ who creates a playlist; after all, they both want to energize and inspire people to keep coming back week after week. Both have to understand pacing: peak too early, people get fatigued and leave; peak too late, people get bored and leave. The delivery of the &#x201c;message&#x201d; has to be just right. All thoughtful people achieve their objectives by creating the appropriate reactions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, virtually every aspect of your business depends on your customer and staff experience. Everything from the financials to the d�cor or the look and &#x201c;vibe&#x201d; of a bar represent foundations from which you can build an amazing experience-reaction dynamic that translates into money. If any one of these elements steals from a positive customer experience, it robs your business and you of potential (not to mention cash).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you start to see your business as a reaction-making machine, you begin to make decisions very differently. Think of it this way: A chef isn&#x2019;t preparing an entr�e; he is, in fact, preparing a guest reaction. The entr�e is the vehicle, not the product. <i>The product is the customer reaction.</i> When that plate hits the table, one of two things will happen: (1) the guest <i>reacts</i> by sitting up and taking notice, or (2) the guest does <i>not</i> react. If nothing happens, that restaurant or bar is &#x201c;stuck.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a restaurant customer doesn&#x2019;t stop talking to her companion and notice the food when it arrives at the table, the establishment is in trouble, or soon will be if the chef doesn&#x2019;t redesign the look of the food on the plate to get a sit-up-and-take-notice customer reaction. I will see that the plate is redesigned five hundred times if necessary&#x2014;as long as it takes to get it right and get a reaction when it is presented to a guest. Customers either notice you in a positive way or they don&#x2019;t. <i>And you can control those reactions to a very large degree.</i> It works whether you&#x2019;re running a storefront operation or a Web-based company, manufacturing widgets or providing a service. In fact, I&#x2019;m so passionate about this concept, I invented and own the term Reaction Management. <br><b>Your One Must-Have: Positive Reactions</b> <br>The connection between reactions and revenue is often overlooked by hospitality and management schools. There are five &#x201c;musts&#x201d; every business professor teaches: an establishment <i>must</i> be convenient, clean, offer quality service, offer a great value, and be safe. That&#x2019;s all true, but these &#x201c;musts&#x201d; are a beginning, not an end point. Achieving them are where customer reactions come in. If all you need are these five basic elements to create a winner, then why do people park ten blocks away from a hot nightclub, step over puddles in its bathroom, squeeze into tiny corner tables, accept rushed service, pay three times more for a drink than the place next door, and walk through a dark parking lot in the middle of the night to get back to their car? How can a spot be so popular if it violates all five &#x201c;musts&#x201d;?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &#x201c;hit&#x201d; is transcendent&#x2014;it offers patrons an experience that produces a powerful, emotionally satisfying reaction. Successful reactions are not about logic; they&#x2019;re about emotions. When you hit a customer&#x2019;s emotions, you reach the Promised Land. That&#x2019;s what this book is about&#x2014;sound business management may be straightforward and logical, but connecting with people isn&#x2019;t. Don&#x2019;t let the logistics overtake the human touch in your business.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove my point, indulge me while I take you on a short trip back in time&#x2014;to 1983, when hair was big and shoulder pads were broad. I was running a new and now legendary dance club called Pulsations in Glen Mills, a suburb of Philadelphia. The concept for the club was a bigger-than-life, high-tech light and music experience. The excitement started before you even got inside. A large neon sign and mirrored building and doorway were the first indications that you were in for something special. There were weekends when people started lining up in the morning just to be the first inside when the doors opened in the evening. It wasn&#x2019;t unusual for the line to stretch around the building and into our rear parking lot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside, club-goers experienced heavy-duty sensory overload: we offered eleven different levels, bars that moved around the main room, a well-stocked gift shop, an extensive snack bar, a VIP room, and an Alternative Music Room (the &#x201c;A&#x201d; Room). Choreographed dance shows performed by pros were highly anticipated nightly events. Pulsations also had one of the most spectacular lighting and sound systems in the world, designed by Richard Long and Associates (now Gary Stewart Audio), the same designers who worked on the Paradise Garage and Studio 54 in New York City.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The club&#x2019;s main attraction, and the one I am proudest of, was a robot named Pulsar (Pulsar was leased for use in <i>Rocky IV</i>). At midnight, this $400,000 technological wonder would descend from the ceiling in a twenty-two-foot spaceship, <i>Genesis 1,</i> to flirt and dance with a random female patron. There are only two times I have cried at work, and the first was when I saw Pulsar make his debut on the dance floor of Pulsations. (You can still catch primitive video of Pulsar doing his thing on YouTube; it made an indelible mark on the scores of people who loved the club.) Pulsar reminded me of the reason I got into the hospitality business: to evoke great emotional responses. Making people smile is a pretty cool way to make a living, wouldn&#x2019;t you agree?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it matter that people had to stand in line for hours to get in? No. Were there complaints on Sunday Teen Nights about the watered-down sodas? Never. Was anyone concerned that they couldn&#x2019;t hear themselves think let alone have a conversation because the music was so loud? No. Were people disturbed that the main dance floor was packed with twenty-five hundred people and the Alternative Music Room, intended for twenty people at a time, was generally jammed with two hundred&#x2014;some of them literally bouncing off the upholstered black walls? Not a bit. Could the bathroom floors have been a little cleaner on a busy Saturday night? Probably. Did anyone care that they weren&#x2019;t? Nope.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulsations probably broke the five &#x201c;musts&#x201d; on a nightly basis. And yet it was the hottest, most talked about club in the Northeast at the time. People would drive three hours from New York City, which had plenty of hot nightclubs in the 1980s, to experience the fun and excitement Pulsations provided. It created some of the most amazing reactions in customers that I have ever been a part of. The club lasted and thrived for fifteen years&#x2014;longer than Studio 54 or any of its other world-class peers. (When new owners took over, the disco era was ending, and they tried to update the place by bringing in exotic dancers&#x2014;a tragically misguided effort that failed. We&#x2019;ll talk more about missteps like that in chapter nine.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many businesses, bars and restaurants aren&#x2019;t always logical, but they&#x2019;re always emotional. There is a science to Reaction Management, but you&#x2019;re always appealing to people on a visceral level. Patrons of hot bars are getting something over and above convenience, cleanliness, quality, price, or safety. They&#x2019;re getting something exciting, enthralling, and fun. Of course it all starts with the ambience, the music, the d�cor, and the look and behavior of the staff&#x2014;a lot of tangibles that, taken together, create an intangible feeling, the heady heyday of Pulsations being a case in point. The important thing to understand is that if you aren&#x2019;t creating great customer reactions, it doesn&#x2019;t matter how clean and convenient your place is&#x2014;it&#x2019;s going to be a snore. However, if you don&#x2019;t have those basic five &#x201c;musts&#x201d; <i>and</i> you&#x2019;re losing revenue, well, you better clean up your act.</p><h2>New Mexico Birds: A Folding Pocket Guide to Familiar Species (Wildlife and Nature Identification)</h2><p>From the Colorado Plateaus in the northwest to the Basin and Range Region in the central and southwest, New Mexico is the permanent or temporary home of over 530 species of birds.

In 1964, these books were combined into the Hiscox Guide for Baptist Churches, which has become a classic work in its own right. At the end of the 20th century, the book was revised and updated by well-respected Baptist pastor and teacher Dr. Everett C. Goodwin.<br><br>The book is divided into eight chapters:<br><br>�Nature of the Church <br>�Membership of the Church <br>�Church ministry <br>�Church leaders and officers <br>�Christian worship <br>�Christian ordinances, rituals and ceremonies <br>�The witness of the Church <br>�Church order, process and discipline<br> <br>Following these chapters are seven appendices that include a Baptist chronology, creeds and confessions, and more.</p><p>A third-generation Baptist minister, Everett C. Goodwin is pastor of Scarsdale Community Church in Scarsdale, New York, and former chaplain at Flint Hill School in Oakton, Virginia. The author of The New Hiscox Guide for Baptist Churches and Baptists in the Balance, Goodwin has pastored congregations in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Washington D.C., where he was senior minister of the historic First Baptist Church.It is an excellent resource for anyone who wishes to have a clear understanding of the Baptist church&#x2014;what it is and how it operates. I highly recommend this book. --Kurt A.

Winner of the <strong>Gerald Loeb Award for Best Business Book of the Year</strong> In the most important business book since <em>The Tipping Point</em>, Chris Anderson shows how the future of commerce and culture isn't in hits, the high-volume head of a traditional demand curve, but in what used to be regarded as misses--the endlessly long tail of that same curve. "It belongs on the shelf between <em>The Tipping Point</em> and <em>Freakonomics</em>."<br>--Reed Hastings, CEO, Netflix "Anderson's insights . . . continue to influence Google's strategic thinking in a profound way." --Eric Schmidt, CEO, Google "Anyone who cares about media . . . must read this book." --Rob Glaser, CEO, RealNetworks</p><p><strong>Chris Anderson</strong> is Editor-in-Chief of <i>Wired</i> magazine, a position he's held since 2001. In 2002 and 2004, he led the magazine to a 2002 National Magazine Awards nomination for General Excellence. He has worked at <i>The Economist</i>, where he served as U.S. Business Editor. His career began at the two premier science journals, <i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i>, where he served in several editorial capacities. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from George Washington University and studied Quantum Mechanics and Science Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley.Anderson's premise that Internet-based retailing and personal expression enable much wider variety and more profitable niche markets and, thus, are killing a formerly "hit-driven" culture and retail world is somewhat controversial. (Just Google THE LONG TAIL.) But this audiobook presents the argument well, with much detail and many current (late 2005) examples. Christopher Nissley's reading style fits the content; he's clipped and staccato, like Anderson's writing. His narration is helpful to the listener who prefers not to get bogged down in the theoretical and technical parts of the book. Anderson himself reads the introduction, and there's a brief author interview at the end of Disc 7, plus downloadable copies of the book's graphics.

It and most of my life revolve around the sport of sailing. In 1993 after graduating from Boston University I hadn't a clue as to what I was going to do with myself. That summer I was doing what I had done every summer since I can remember, racing sailboats.In August, I won a National Championship and decided to train for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. While training full time, a friend sent me to see a designer at Ralph Lauren, who was in search of real sailors to model in a Polo Sport advertising campaign. I had an incredible time and months later my picture was seen around the world. More importantly, I met a true friend and eventual mentor, Bruce Weber, who was the photographer on the shoot. Bruce continued to take pictures of me sailing and after failing to make the '96 US Sailing Team, I found myself in New York at the start of a new modeling career. Modeling led me into acting, but the dream of a gold medal still lingered in the back of my mind. After a few years, I dropped everything and decided to jump back in the boat and train for the Sydney '00 Games. It was during this time that Bruce encouraged me to start taking pictures of sailboats. My training paid off landing me a berth on the 2000 US Sailing Team. Shortly afterward, I took up the camera and while shooting a regatta I turned the camera on a fellow model/actor and friend of mine who had come along for the day. Those pictures ended up in his portfolio and created the outset of my new career. Since then my pictures have led me into advertising and my clients now include Levi's, Reebok, DKNY, Johnnie Walker and Axe Deodorant to name a few. I am continually growing as a photographer and I'm so glad that my crazy path has landed me here with a camera in hand. I would like to give a special thanks to Caggie Simonelli, Bruce Weber, and Josette Lata for making this possible.&#x201d;<br></p><h2>ATI TEAS Crash Course� Book + Online: Get a Higher Score in Less Time (Nursing Test Prep)</h2><p><b>NEW!

Her little brother, Ian, who has autism, wants to go, too. Ian doesn&#39;t have the same reactions to all the sights and sounds that his sisters have, and Julie thinks he looks silly.</p><p>L Lears is an Albert Whitman author.Gr. 2^-3, younger for reading aloud. So genuine are the paintings of narrator Julie, her big sister, Tara, and her younger autistic brother, Ian, that the three children look as though they will continue walking, tying a shoe, or feeding the ducks just as soon as the page is turned. As Tara and Julie take Ian along on their walk to the park, Julie describes how Ian acts differently from most people, showing no interest, for example, in the food or customers in Nan's diner and paying attention only to the rotating ceiling fan. Admirably patient with Ian, Julie nevertheless grows angry with his seemingly stubborn ways. Yet her close observations of her brother serve her well when Ian wanders away. By thinking of what Ian likes to do, Julie finds her brother and ushers him home again. Through its simple plot, the story conveys a complex family relationship and demonstrates the ambivalent emotions Julie feels about her autistic brother. This natural mix of resentment, anger, isolation, loyalty, and love is explained in preliminary notes written by professional pediatric caregivers. Sensitizing readers to these dynamics as well as to the autistic condition, this book offers a valuable, warmly told lesson. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>An Easy Death (1) (Gunnie Rose)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Immersive, involving, suspenseful, and intriguing, with a main character you&#x2019;ll love.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lee Child, #1 internationally bestselling author of the Jack Reacher novels</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;A gripping, twisty-turny, thrill ride of a read.&#x201d; &#x2014;Karin Slaughter,<i> New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Pieces of Her</i></b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;When a master of her craft offers to tell you a story, let her.

Tarken and Martin would be tinkering with the truck, which was our livelihood. Galilee would be watching Martin, because they had started seeing each other before and after work. Or she would be cleaning her little house, or washing her clothes. I never saw Galilee bored or idle.<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t have to be at Martin&#x2019;s until late that afternoon, so I was doing whatever I pleased. That morning I was pleased to get rid of my hair.<br> <br>My neighbor Chrissie was not too bright, but I&#x2019;d watched her trim her husband&#x2019;s hair and beard as he sat on a stool outside their cabin. She&#x2019;d done a good job. She sang as she worked, in her sweet, high voice, and she told me about her youngest one&#x2019;s adventures with a frog in the creek.<br> <br>When she was halfway done, she said, &#x201c;Why you want to cut all this off? It&#x2019;s so pretty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It gets all sweaty and sticks to my neck,&#x201d; I said. Which was true. It was only spring now, but it would be the hot season soon.<br> <br>&#x201c;You better wear you a hat so your head won&#x2019;t get all red and tender,&#x201d; Chrissie said. &#x201c;You want it so short I think the sun might get your scalp.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care,&#x201d; I said, holding up the only little mirror Chrissie had. I could see part of my head at a time. She&#x2019;d washed it, so my hair was wet. I thought it was about an inch long. Looked like the curl was gone, but I wouldn&#x2019;t know until it dried.<br> <br>&#x201c;You heading out soon? I saw them farmers at Martin&#x2019;s place, when I was coming back from the store.&#x201d; Chrissie&#x2019;s trousers had long tendrils of dark hair all over &#x2019;em now. She&#x2019;d have to brush &#x2019;em.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, we&#x2019;re leaving as soon as it&#x2019;s near dark.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you scared?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sure, I was. &#x201c;Of course not, the only ones should be scared are anyone who tries to get in our way.&#x201d; I smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll kill &#x2019;em dead, bang, bang,&#x201d; Chrissie said in a singsong voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. Bang, bang,&#x201d; I agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are they going to New America?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The farmers? The part of Texas they live in got swallowed up by Mexico a few years ago. You remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>Chrissie looked dim. She shook her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway, the government down there has been telling the Texans that they&#x2019;re not real Mexicans, and their land is forfeit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chrissie looked even dimmer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Their land is getting taken. So if they&#x2019;ve got kin up north or anywhere, even in Dixie, they got to leave Mexico to have a chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dixie was so poor and so dangerous you&#x2019;d have to be desperate to flee there.<br> <br>Chrissie ran her fingers through the short hair on the left side of my head, and shook her head. &#x201c;Anyone ever go to the HRE?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chrissie,&#x201d; I said. She bent around to meet my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry, Lizbeth.&#x201d; She began to work on the right side, following her own whim. I tried to remember if I&#x2019;d ever seen her cut anyone&#x2019;s hair besides Norton&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I forgot you don&#x2019;t like them grigoris.&#x201d;<br> <br>No. I did not like magicians.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tarken know you&#x2019;re doing this?&#x201d; she said after a moment. I could tell by the faraway sound of her voice that the question had come from her mouth, not her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, he doesn&#x2019;t have a say in my hair. Don&#x2019;t you go telling.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll see it this afternoon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s a surprise,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Chrissie gave me one of those looks that reminded me she was older than I was. &#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t gonna like it, Lizbeth.&#x201d;<br> <br>I raised up my shoulders, very carefully, because I didn&#x2019;t want to jolt her hand. &#x201c;Not his head,&#x201d; I said, and that was the truth. But it was also true that he&#x2019;d tried to tell me how I should do something one time too many.<br> <br>When Chrissie had finished, and the little mirror told me it was cut evenly all over&#x2014;God knows how&#x2014;I paid her. She gave me a big smile before she carried the chair inside. She came back out to pump some water to wash her hands, and put some in a bucket to toss around, trying to spread out the long, dark hair that lay in a heap where the chair had stood.<br> <br>I gave her a hand. When the dirt didn&#x2019;t look like the sky had snowed black ringlets, I went uphill to my place.<br> <br>Getting ready to leave didn&#x2019;t take long. We should only be gone maybe three nights, at most. And we might even spring for a room in one of the hotels in Corbin . . . providing Tarken was speaking to me by then. We&#x2019;d get the farmers up to their waiting family, then we&#x2019;d come right home. It was the most common run we made, and Martin and Tarken had cleared a road to there, mostly on an old paved one. They&#x2019;d moved all the big rocks and trees, scouted out the likely ambush sites, and so on.<br> <br>Corbin was over the border in New America, which was where almost all our cargo was bound. It was a bustling town with a number of places to stay, a garage for cars, a stable for horses, a post office, a good general store.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d worked for Tarken for two years now, maybe a bit over, and he&#x2019;d been my man for four months. The first time we went to bed, he told me he&#x2019;d been waiting until I was old enough.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t even realized he was looking at me. I&#x2019;m slow that way. But I&#x2019;m quick with a gun, that&#x2019;s what counts.<br> <br>I would never have known I had a talent if my stepfather, Jackson, hadn&#x2019;t taken me hunting with him when I was little. Jackson had seen me snatch a fly out of the air, he told me later, and he&#x2019;d thought I had the quick hands and the instincts you needed to be a gunnie.<br> <br>Jackson was right. The first time I held a rifle in my hands, I knew I&#x2019;d found my calling. My mother didn&#x2019;t like it, of course, but at least I could support myself&#x2014;and be out in the open&#x2014;doing something useful. People need protection.<br> <br>I stuck a pair of pants and a shirt into my small leather bag, a pair of underpants, my toothbrush, and a comb. Packing was done. I&#x2019;d fill my canteens before I left.<br> <br>Next I cleaned my old 1873 Winchester, a lever action and a great rifle. It had been my grandfather&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;d called it Jackhammer, so I did, too. Jackson had given me matched Colt 1911s for close work, and those were already clean after my last target-shooting session out in the empty land around Segundo Mexia. I could fire twenty-seven bullets with all three, had extra magazines ready for the Colts. If I couldn&#x2019;t bring our enemies down with that much firepower, our enemies had an army.<br> <br>Galilee would bring her rifle, a Krag, since she was better at long shooting. I&#x2019;d use the Winchester for the nearer work. She and Martin and Tarken all had pistols, too, though Tarken&#x2019;s was less than a great tool.<br> <br>Our truck and our firepower had worked for two years. We&#x2019;d made this same run often.<br> <br>Winchester in its sling over my back, pistols in their holsters and ready to go, two full canteens on one shoulder, my little leather bag with clothes and extra ammo on another; I was ready. I set off down the path to town.<br> <br>People were coming home from work, and Chrissie was cooking on a grill outside her cabin, the smoke rising up and the smell of meat giving the air a nice tang. &#x201c;Good shooting!&#x201d; she called in her soft voice.<br> <br>I nodded. I passed Rex Santino. &#x201c;Easy death,&#x201d; he said in his gruff way.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what people wished gunnies. It made me feel good. I nodded back at him.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to walk down Main Street. There were too many people. One of them was my mother, who lived with Jackson in a real nice house just off Main. She didn&#x2019;t like to see me leave on a job. That weakened me, too. I took a roundabout way to Martin&#x2019;s house, which was situated in a bare dirt lot on the last street north in Segundo Mexia.<br> <br>Martin&#x2019;s chickens squawked in their pen as I came into the yard. He was strewing feed and smiling, just a little. He sure liked those stupid chickens. His neighbor&#x2019;s kids would come in to feed them while Martin was gone, in exchange for eggs. We do a lot of barter in Segundo Mexia.<br> <br>The setting sun struck Martin&#x2019;s head with a golden glow. For the first time I noticed that his light hair had a lot of gray sprinkled in. I would pick my time to tease him about it.<br> <br>Galilee wasn&#x2019;t there yet. Tarken was putting the cans of extra gas on the bed of the truck, and he gave me a sideways smile, which froze when he realized my hair was gone. After a minute he closed his eyes, shook his head, and started back to working.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d hear about this later. I smiled. It was going to be fun.<br> <br>Most of the cargo was sitting on the dirt of the yard or on Martin&#x2019;s front porch. Two of the children were playing a game of hopscotch on the grid they&#x2019;d drawn in the dirt. I nodded in their direction. I would talk to them when I couldn&#x2019;t dodge it.<br> <br>The sky went lower, the people on the porch shared out food among themselves, and I went into Martin&#x2019;s kitchen and ate some bread and some dried fruit. I couldn&#x2019;t handle meat before a job.<br> <br>Galilee came in to sit with me, her Krag under her arm. She had on a gun belt with one pistol, maybe not as fine as my Colts&#x2014;but the Colts were courtesy of Jackson, so I didn&#x2019;t crow about them . . . much. Her hair stood out from her head like a huge black puff, and she was very skinny and dark. &#x201c;My friend, you look a sight,&#x201d; she said when she got a good look at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Like it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hell, no. You had the prettiest white-person hair I ever saw. Why&#x2019;d you do it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tarken liked it too much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you decided you&#x2019;d show him what was what.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. &#x201c;More or less.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Girl. Sometimes I can tell you are so young.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know what that meant, so I didn&#x2019;t answer. Only, I&#x2019;d figured since Tarken spent so long running his fingers through my hair, straightening out each ringlet to watch it bounce back into curl, he&#x2019;d better pay more attention to the girl whose scalp it grew on.<br> <br>Galilee talked about other stuff. &#x201c;Freedom built a chair for his little house,&#x201d; she told me. Her son Freedom, who&#x2019;d been born when Galilee was only fourteen, had moved out of his mom&#x2019;s house when he left school and had gotten a job at the tannery. Now he&#x2019;d built his own place. (And a chair.)<br> <br>&#x201c;He going to find a carpenter to apprentice to?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t think of anyone around who&#x2019;d be ready to hire. Bobby Saw already had a girl working for him.<br> <br>Galilee lost some smile. &#x201c;You know Freedom. That boy can&#x2019;t stick with nothing. At least, not that he&#x2019;s found yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That boy&#x201d; and I were nearly the same age. At least Freedom had stuck with the tannery job. Though he didn&#x2019;t like the work, it was steady money. He kept looking for something else, but nothing had suited him yet. Last time I&#x2019;d seen him in a bar, he&#x2019;d groused about it nonstop. He was lucky his girlfriend was sticking with him. Complaining is not attractive.<br> <br>Martin came in to get a drink, kissed Galilee on the cheek as he went by. My eyebrows tried to climb into my hair, what was left of it. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said when he&#x2019;d gone back out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re out in the open with it. When did that happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t meet my eyes, but she was smiling again. &#x201c;Just seemed like it was time. We&#x2019;re getting along good, we want to spend more time together than we are. Ain&#x2019;t no big thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet,&#x201d; she agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lizbeth,&#x201d; Tarken called from the yard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Time to work,&#x201d; Galilee said, and we washed our plates and went to the outhouse and then to the truck. It was spring, days lengthening, and the sun didn&#x2019;t want to give up the sky. There were no clouds, and I stood looking up, seeing the vastness above me, nothing between me and the hereafter. I had my place, standing here on this dirt.<br> <br>Tarken gave us the nod. He and Martin were taking one last-minute look at the engine.<br> <br>Galilee and I turned to the cargo. &#x201c;Time to load up,&#x201d; I called. &#x201c;Sit in the center, looking out. Her and me, we got to stand up, her at the right side close to the back, me at the left side, closer to the front.&#x201d; I pointed. I had to be clear. They were nervous.<br> <br>Tarken would cover the straight-ahead from the passenger seat in the cab.<br> <br>Martin had already arranged their bags against the sides, with two gaps left for me and Galilee just where we wanted them. The cargo had brought too much stuff, but they&#x2019;d tried to pack it all in. They hated to leave things. This was all they had in the world.<br> <br>The long, flat bed had sides Martin and Tarken had built, wooden uprights and horizontal planks, to hold everyone and everything in. Provided a little protection, too. And that gave Galilee and me a stable frame to lean on. We would go in last.<br> <br>The families were standing, milling around, putting it off. &#x201c;Load up,&#x201d; I called with a little more push to my voice.<br> <br>They obeyed. One man went in first, to help pull up the wives and the children, while the other remained on the ground to boost &#x2019;em up. The younger couple had a baby and a couple of littles, maybe six and four. The older couple had a girl, grown, and another girl about thirteen, and a boy, younger but not a baby. The men were brothers. They&#x2019;d had farms side by side in south Texas, but when it had become Mexico, they had gradually been pushed out. Their older brother, they&#x2019;d told Martin, was the one paying for their trip to New America. He was smarter; he&#x2019;d sold his farm while he still had title to it, and bought land north of Corbin.<br> <br>It seemed to take a long time, but finally they were all in. Galilee and I scrambled up and took our places. It was Galilee&#x2019;s turn to talk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hear me,&#x201d; she said, and they all turned their faces to her. Dixie people wouldn&#x2019;t have listened to a black woman, but these farmers did. She had the way and voice of someone who knew what she was doing. Her rifle spoke for her, too.<br> <br>Galilee gave them the usual lecture about staying low and helping us keep watch. They all nodded, even the littles, scared just about shitless. Our prime worry was bandits, who wanted anything they could get: guns, goods, the human cargo. The guns and goods could be used or sold. The humans could be robbed or raped, and then sold to a bordello that wasn&#x2019;t too choosy.<br> <br>If the New America patrols stopped us, we&#x2019;d be fine. People were legal cargo, and respectable people like this were even welcome in New America. But if bandits caught us, well, that was why Galilee and I were on duty. That was why the oldest brother had hired us to get the two families through the lawless land along the border between Texoma and New America.<br> <br>Martin had climbed into the driver&#x2019;s seat, and Tarken had taken the shotgun position, as usual. I stretched forward to rap on the cab roof, letting them know she&#x2019;d made the speech. The engine began to rumble, and we lurched out of the yard.<br> <br>As we were leaving Segundo Mexia, I spotted Freedom walking by the side of the road and gave him a yell. At the sight of the truck, he took off his hat and waved it at his mother, who raised her hand in farewell.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you soon, son!&#x201d; she called.<br> <br>I could feel the farm people&#x2019;s eyes going from the boy to his mother. The two were not exactly the same color. Galilee had gotten pregnant by the son of the landowner her parents worked for. Her parents had sacrificed to help Galilee run away. In Dixie, kids who didn&#x2019;t look like their black mothers were in for a very hard time.<br> <br>After many adventures, mostly bad, some good, Galilee had ended up in Segundo Mexia. But along the way, she&#x2019;d learned to shoot. She had a skill. I trusted her with my life.<br> <br>We were on a good part of the ...</p><h2>Inner Dimensions of Islamic Worship</h2><p><p>In this book readers are led on a powerful and inspiring journey through the inner dimensions of a range of Islamic acts, including prayer, almsgiving, fasting, and pilgrimage.</p><p>Consisting of a selection of writings by a great figure in Islamic history, Imam al-Ghazali, this book helps readers realize the benefits of the upliftment of their spiritual, social, and moral qualities.</p><p><b>Al-Ghazali</b> (1058&#x2013;1111), a towering figure in Islam, was born at Tus, near Mashhad in Iran, in the early Seljuq era.

His formidable intellectual abilities soon won him honour and respect at the court of the famous Seljuqi Prime Minister, Nizam al-Mulk, and, while still in his early thirties, he became Professor at Madrasa Nizamiyya in Baghdad and attained great prominence there.

Fought during the worst blizzard in a century, it is considered by the United States Marine Corps to be &#x201c;the Corps' finest hour.&#x201d; Fourteen Medals of Honor, a record for any American battle, and eighty-five Navy Crosses--many awarded in lieu of an original nomination for the Medal of Honor--attest to the intensity of the battle. </p><p> Based on first-person interviews from surviving veterans who came to be known as the &#x201c;Frozen Chosen,&#x201d; this is the incredible story of heroism and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, as a handful of Marines fought desperately against wave after wave of Chinese forces. Sometimes forced into desperate hand-to-hand fighting in intense cold, cut off from reinforcements, and with dwindling supplies and ammunition, the fighting retreat from Chosin marked one of the darkest moments for Western forces in Korea, it but would go on to resonate with generations of Marines as a symbol of the Marine Corps' dogged determination, fighting skill, and never-say-die attitude on the battlefield.</p></p><p>Thomas McKelvey Cleaver has been a published writer for the past 40 years.

While Auntie June and Uncle Jonah watch for wildlife and set up their campsites, Rhoda is on the hunt for one thing: ROCKS.<br><br>She finds them in all shapes and patterns, from hearts and hats to stripes and sparkles. And every last treasure goes into her pack, making it heavier and heavier as they hike through forests and along streams. Soon Rhoda is sweaty, and tired of salami sandwiches, and wishing for her own bed. Then, on the last day, they come to the Big Lake. And its beach is covered in rocks. Rhoda can't believe her luck.<br><br>After hours of play and even more rock discoveries, it's time to head for home. By now Rhoda's pack is too heavy to lift. Will she give up her rocks and return to the cabin for a real shower, a hot meal, and a soft bed? Or will she stay on the beach forever with her beloved collection? Her clever solution makes the most of her treasures&#x2014;and offers delights for other hikers.</p><p>Jennifer A. Bell has illustrated over a dozen children&#x2019;s books, most recently Toe Shoe Mouse and When a Dad Says &#x201c;I Love You.&#x201d;PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;When Rhoda goes with Auntie June, Uncle Jonah, and their perky little dog on a "long, long hike from their up-north cabin," her aunt is interested in photographing birds; her uncle in camping; and the dog in adventure and exploring. But Rhoda is a rock hunter. Everywhere they go, she finds rocks&#x2014;near the lake, on the forest path, in a rushing stream, and, especially, on the beach beside the Big Lake. Rhoda picks up smooth, striped, and sparkly rocks; colored rocks and plain rocks; rocks that fit perfectly into her hand, and others with all sorts of shapes. Finally, with her small backpack so loaded she cannot lift it, the child must decide what to do with her multitude of treasures. Bell's cartoon illustrations bring this simple story to life. Scenes of woods, lakes, beaches, and boulder-edged stream offer a somewhat inviting glimpse of hiking and camping with a charming freckle-faced little girl who loses herself in the part of nature she likes best.&#x2014;Susan Scheps, formerly at Shaker Public Library, OH</p><h2>Facilitating Financial Health: Tools for Financial Planners, Coaches, and Therapists, 2nd Edition</h2><p>With the newly revised 2nd Edition, Facilitating Financial Health remains a one-of-a-kind publication that bridges the gap between financial planners and mental health practitioners.

He also predicted the date of the death of the Messiah to occur in AD 32, the date of the rebirth of the nation of Israel to occur in AD 1948, and the Israeli capture of the Temple Mount to take place in AD 1967! Commentary from the ancient rabbis and the first century church reveals how the messianic rabbis and the disciples of the apostles interpreted his prophecies. Daniel also indicated where the Antichrist would come from, where he would place his international headquarters, and identified the three rebel nations that will attack him during the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation.

Chivers traces the invention of the assault rifle, following the miniaturization of rapid-fire arms from the American Civil War, through WWI, Vietnam, to present day Afghanistan when Kalashnikovs and their knock-offs number as many as 100 million, one for every seventy persons on earth.<br><br>At a secret arms-design contest in Stalin&#x2019;s Soviet Union, army technicians submitted a stubby rifle with a curved magazine. Dubbed the AK-47, it was selected as the Eastern Bloc&#x2019;s standard arm. Scoffed at in the Pentagon as crude and unimpressive, it was in fact a breakthrough&#x2014;a compact automatic that could be mastered by almost anyone, last decades in the field, and would rarely jam. Manufactured by tens of millions in planned economies, it became first an instrument of repression and then the most lethal weapon of the Cold War. Soon it was in the hands of terrorists.<br> <br>In a searing examination of modern conflict and official folly, C. J. Chivers mixes meticulous historical research, investigative reporting, and battlefield reportage to illuminate the origins of the world&#x2019;s most abundant firearm and the consequences of its spread. The result, a tour de force of history and storytelling, sweeps through the miniaturization and distribution of automatic firepower, and puts an iconic object in fuller context than ever before.<br> <br><i>The Gun </i>dismantles myths as it moves from the na�ve optimism of the Industrial Revolution through the treacherous milieu of the Soviet Union to the inside records of the Taliban. Chivers tells of the 19th-century inventor in Indianapolis who designs a Civil War killing machine, insisting that more-efficient slaughter will save lives. A German attach� who observes British machine guns killing Islamic warriors along the Nile advises his government to amass the weapons that would later flatten British ranks in World War I. In communist Hungary, a locksmith acquires an AK-47 to help wrest his country from the Kremlin&#x2019;s yoke, beginning a journey to the gallows. The Pentagon suppresses the results of firing tests on severed human heads that might have prevented faulty rifles from being rushed to G.I.s in Vietnam. In Africa, a millennial madman arms abducted children and turns them on their neighbors, setting his country ablaze. Neither pro-gun nor anti-gun, <i>The Gun </i>builds to a terrifying sequence, in which a young man who confronts a trio of assassins is shattered by 23 bullets at close range. The man survives to ask questions that Chivers examines with rigor and flair.<br> <br>Throughout, <i>The Gun </i>animates unforgettable characters&#x2014;inventors, salesmen, heroes, megalomaniacs, racists, dictators, gunrunners, terrorists, child soldiers, government careerists, and fools. Drawing from years of research, interviews, and from declassified records revealed for the first time, he presents a richly human account of an evolution in the very experience of war.</p><p>C.J. Chivers&nbsp;is a correspondent for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i> and a writer-at-large for&nbsp;<i>the New York Times Magazine</i>. His magazine story &#x201c;The Fighter&#x201d; won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing. In 2009 he was part of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for coverage from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Chivers served as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps in the Persian Gulf War and on peacekeeping duty during the Los Angeles riots. He is the author of <i>The Gun&nbsp;</i>and <i>The&nbsp;</i><i>Fighters.&nbsp;</i>The AK-47 assault rifle is the defining weapon of the post-WWII era, thanks to its reliability, simplicity, and effectiveness. Over a hundred million units have been manufactured in enough variants-including imitations-to provide one for every 70 people in the world. It is praised in equal measure by soldiers, insurgents, hunters, and police. In his first book Chivers, a Marine Corps vet and senior writer at the New York Times who has reported extensively from Afghanistan and Pakistan, combines recently declassified documents with extensive personal accounts of AK-47 users from around the world. Without denying the familiar contributions of Mikhail Kalashnikov, Chivers describes the AK-47 as a product of the Soviet system. The quest for an individual weapon with the firepower of a light machine gun and the portability of a machine pistol dated from the First World War, but Stalin gave it top priority with the beginning of the Cold War. Chivers vividly depicts the false starts and the eventual success, as when the gun aided in suppressing the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and its subsequent global distribution and evolution into "everyman's gun." An extensive comparison with the US M-16 enhances this outstanding history of an exceptional instrument of war. <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Originally from New England, she now lives in Northern California with her wonderful partner, a couple of felines, and a handful of rodents. Her love for art is rivaled only by her love for animals, and she spends her spare time as a volunteer wildlife rehabber. She loves painting, needle felting, and losing herself in a good video game.From the seagulls in flight on the end pages onward, readers are taken on a journey through the natural world. Various environments and seasons are displayed on bright double-page spreads. Creatively placed rhyming text introduces us to many different animals, and shows what they have in common. Often, it&#x2019;s surprising: readers may not know that both crabs and butterflies (as well as many insects) are arthropods. Curves dominate the scene, from the circle on the cover to the tide pool on the final page, and even the language reverberates with movement. Lang reminds us that we don&#x2019;t yet understand all animals on earth, but Laberis&#x2019; illustrations make them accessible and charming, with most animals seen in families or at least pairs. The world of her illustrations is warm and inviting; even the dark, deep ocean is mitigated by the playful swirls of octopus tentacles. Endnotes add more information for the curious reader. Pair with Creature Features: 25 Animals Explain Why They Look the Way They Do (2014), by Steve Jenkins and Robin Page. &#x2014; Edie Ching -- Booklist, <i>Jan 11, 2018</i><br><br>Major similarities and differences among six classes of animals&#x2014;and two additional animal categories&#x2014;are explained with the aid of simple rhymes and sophisticated art. A text that aspires to reveal nature facts using rhythm and rhyme can easily fall into pitfalls&#x2014;sometimes sacrificing meaning for good scansion or vice versa. Amazingly, this book manages to convey elemental facts about animals with verse that both scans and informs. The initial double-page spread shows two children gazing at creatures in a tide pool. The book's opening (and closing) lines emphasize the idea that Earth's animals have many tangible differences but also that all are, as the subtitle says, "kin." Variations that categorize each family are discussed and illustrated in the pages that follow. An excellent double-page spread of appealing mammals illustrating the qualifying traits of milk, fur, warmbloodedness, live birth, and parental care is followed by an equally thoughtful spread with a lineup of humans as mammals that contains diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, and the many ways that human families are defined. Categories beyond common animal families include "detritovores," which merits this descriptive&#x2014;and humorous&#x2014;couplet: "Detritovores, so oft forgotten, / dine on things both dead and rotten." As with the rest of the text, the couplet is followed by further explanation of the category and accompanied by vibrant, detailed art. Backmatter provides both further information and resources for readers who want to help animals. A very welcome addition to nature shelves. (Informational picture book. 3-8)&nbsp; -- Kirkus STARRED REVIEW, <i>3/1/18</i><br><br>The book opens with a big idea: &#x201c;All animals on Earth are kin, while not the same outside or in.&#x201d; Various classes of animals are then introduced&#x2014;birds, amphibians, reptiles, and a few &#x201c;mixed categories&#x201d; such as water dweller. Rhyming text is used throughout to define each group and briefly mention its features. For example, the book defines amphibians (&#x201c;Changing body, smooth, moist skin: that is an amphibian.&#x201d;) and then shows the process of metamorphosis&#x2014;a tadpole changing into a toad, salamander, frog, or newt. The colorful illustrations work seamlessly with the text to both reinforce the written information and add additional details. Back matter provides more information about each creature covered and gives additional sources for further investigation. Pair this book with Jonathan Tweet&#x2019;s Grandmother Fish: A Child&#x2019;s First Book of Evolution more animal-related science for young learners. VERDICT A clear, inviting introduction to the study of animals. A very good choice for reading aloud and discussing. -- School Library Journal, <i>March 2018</i><br><br>&#x201c;All animals on Earth are kin,/ while not the same outside or in./ Some we stroke with loving hand;/ some we don&#x2019;t yet understand,&#x201d; writes Lang in this uplifting celebration of life that identifies and groups animals according to their taxonomic class. Laberis renders the animal groups in a warm, naturalistic style. One spread features a series of mammal mothers and offspring&#x2014;a bear and cubs, a cat nursing kittens, and a whale and calf. Other spreads show a small number of animals within their natural habitats, including a spider in its web, a frog and tadpoles in a pond, and an octopus in its den. Lang highlights the biodiversity of her subjects through her vivid verses: &#x201c;Detrivores, so oft forgotten,/ dine on things both dead and rotten./ Worms and bugs make their dessert of rot into the richest dirt./ Underground or deep in bark.../they&#x2019;re heroes of the damp and dark.&#x201d; One spread features a diverse group of human families (&#x201c;yes, we&#x2019;re mammals, too!&#x201d;), emphasizing the interconnectedness of all living things. -- Publishers Weekly, <i>March 19, 2018</i></p><h2>The Incendiaries: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>Now a National Bestseller</b><br><br>"<b>Religion, politics, and love collide in this slim but powerful novel reminiscent of Donna Tartt's <i>The Secret History</i>, with menace and mystery lurking in every corner." --<i>People Magazine</i></b><br><br><b>"The most buzzed-about debut of the summer, as it should be...unusual and enticing ... <i>The Incendiaries </i>arrives at precisely the right moment." --<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br><b>"Radiant...A dark, absorbing story of how first love can be as intoxicating and dangerous as religious fundamentalism." --<i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br><b>A powerful, darkly glittering novel of violence, love, faith, and loss, as a young woman at an elite American university is drawn into a cult's acts of terrorism.</b></b><br><br>Phoebe Lin and Will Kendall meet in their first month at prestigious Edwards University.

Platt Hall, I think, eleven floors up: I know his ego, and he&#x2019;d have picked the tallest point he could. So often, I&#x2019;ve imagined how they felt, waiting. With six minutes left, the slant light of dusk reddened the high old spiresof the college, the level gables of its surrounding town. They poured festive wine into big-bellied glasses. Hands shaking, they laughed. She would sit apart from this reveling group, cross-legged on the roof&#x2019;s west ledge. Three minutes to go, two, one.<br><br>The Phipps building fell. Smoke plumed, the breath of God. Silence followed, then the group&#x2019;s shouts of triumph. Wine glasses clashed together, flashing martial light. He sang the first bars of a Jejah psalm. Others soon joined in. Carillon bells chimed, distant birds blowing white, strewn, like dandelion tufts, an outsize wish. It must have been then that John Leal came to her side. In his bare feet, he closed his arm around her shoulders. She flinched, looking up at him. I can imagine how he&#x2019;d have tightened his hold, telling her she&#x2019;d done well, though before long, it would be time to act again, to do a little more&#x2014;<br><br>But this is where I start having trouble, Phoebe. Buildings fell. People died. You once told me I hadn&#x2019;t even tried to understand. So, here I am, trying.<br><br> 2.<br><br>John Leal<br><br>Once John Leal left Noxhurst, halfway through his last term of college, he drifted until he ended up in Yanji, China. In this city, adjacent to North Korea, he began working with an activist group that smuggled Korean refugees toward asylum in Seoul. He&#x2019;d found his life&#x2019;s work, he thought.<br><br>Instead, he was kidnapped by North Korean agents, spirited across the border, and thrown into a prison camp outside of Pyongyang. In the stories he later told the group, he said the gulag brutalities were bad enough, but at least they&#x2019;d been expected. What astonished him was the allegiance his fellow inmates showed toward the lunatic despot whose policies had installed them in their cells. They&#x2019;d been jailed because, oh, they&#x2019;d splashed a drop of tea on his newsprint portrait. A �neighbor claimed to have overheard them whistling a South �Korean pop song. Punished for absurdities, they still maintained that the beloved sovereign, a divine being, couldn&#x2019;t be to blame. At first, he assumed this was lip service, the prisoners afraid to say otherwise. But then, he thought of the refugees he&#x2019;d met in Yanji, how they talked of loving the god they&#x2019;d fled. They attributed the regime&#x2019;s troubles to anyone but the sole person in charge.<br><br>A month into John Leal&#x2019;s time in the gulag, prison guards held an optional foot race, the prize a framed icon of the despot. In the confusion, those who fell were trampled. One child died of a broken spine. Through howls of pain, he shouted hosannahs for his lord. They weren&#x2019;t lying, the poor fools. They believed in the man as one might believe in Jesus Christ. Some people needed leading. In or out of the gulag, they craved faith. But think if the tyrant had been as upright as his disciples trusted him to be. The heights he&#x2019;d have achieved, if he loved them&#x2014;if, John Leal thought, until his idea began.<br><br> 3.<br><br>Phoebe<br><br>I hoped I&#x2019;d be a piano genius, Phoebe told the group, in the first Jejah confession she tried giving. She&#x2019;d have sat in the circle, holding a kidskin journal. Though I&#x2019;d driven Phoebe here, I was outside, going home. It&#x2019;s a mistake. I should have stayed, but I didn&#x2019;t. Instead, I&#x2019;ll add what details I can. The full lips, spit-�polished. She licked them, tense. I&#x2019;m striving to picture it: Phoebe, talking. The thin, long-fingered hands folded tight. She looked down, inhaled.<br><br>But I didn&#x2019;t just wait, she said. I expected, no, I wanted to work for it. I spilled time into the piano as I&#x2019;d have put cash in a bank. I saw full concert halls in the future, solo recitals. Front-page plaudits. I practiced Liszt while imagined spotlights gilded the living room. Recollection is half invention, but it feels as though I spent my entire childhood training to prove I was the significant pianist I believed I&#x2019;d be.<br><br>So, I piled up trophies. It wasn&#x2019;t enough. The teacher flicked my hands with a rod each time I didn&#x2019;t hit the right note, but I didn&#x2019;t mind. My ambition outstripped his. Let my hands swell. I could use the extra span. Bright-knuckled, I tried again. The months ticked past, then years. I kept lists of rivals; I indexed others&#x2019; exploits by age. Kiehl, at five, had given his first recital to the Danish king. Ohri, eleven, debuted at Carnegie Hall; Liu, fifteen. One night, my teacher called Libich&#x2019;s �tude no. 5 the most challenging piece a soloist might attempt. It&#x2019;s eluded the finest pianists, he said. I rushed to find the �tude&#x2019;s score. I learned it alone, in secret. I memorized Libich&#x2019;s high trills. I flailed through wild ostinatos.<br>________ Once, at the table, my mother asked what I was smiling about. Haejin, she said.<br><br>I blinked, Libich vibrating in my head. I, I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;<br><br>She laughed. It&#x2019;s all right, she said. I ate while she peeled a white peach. The skin dropped in a single coil. She picked it up, holding it to the light. Such a rich hue, she said. It flushed pink, backlit; I nodded, then she put it down. I could tell she wished to talk, but I was lost in trills. I pushed a last peach slice in my mouth, and I went back to the piano.<br>________<br><br>Until then, nothing I played had evoked the orphic singing I knew to be possible. It was an ideal I lacked the skill to bring to life. Each first-place prize marked a point when I&#x2019;d let the music down. With Libich, I failed less. His �tude asked so much of me that, at times, I&#x2019;d forget I had an I. I should have learned, from this, that playing had to be birthed in a place without ego, in which I didn&#x2019;t exist except as the living conduit, Libich&#x2019;s medium. But then, when I showed the teacher what I could do, he was astonished. I&#x2019;d achieved more than he&#x2019;d hoped, he said. He switched the piece in for the next competition, a city-level open. I was driven to the recital hall. The sun fell on my hands as I practiced Libich again, fingers dancing across my legs. Spotlit, I listened to the traffic sing my name. The lax blue of L.A., heat-rippled, veiled the horizon. Like curtains, I thought, poised to rise.<br><br> 4.<br><br>Will<br><br>I first met Phoebe in a house full of strangers, five weeks into the Edwards fall term. I was new to the Noxhurst school, but a sophomore, a late arrival. I&#x2019;d transferred in from the Bible college I&#x2019;d had to leave, and I was often on my own. Then, one night, while I was taking a walk alone, I noticed a loud throng of students turning into a gate. It was left propped open; I followed them in. Hip-hop pulsed, rolled. Pale limbs shone. I&#x2019;d learned that the alcohol table was the one place where I could stand without looking too isolated, and I was idling at my usual station, finishing a third drink, when a girl in a striped dress tripped. She spilled cold liquid down my leg.<br><br>She shouted apologies, then a name: Phoebe Lin. Will Kendall, I said, also in a shout. We tried talking, but I kept mishearing what she said. Phoebe started tilting her pelvis from side to side. Life as a juvenile born-again hadn&#x2019;t put me on a lot of dance floors; uncertain, I followed the girl&#x2019;s lead. She swayed left, right, bare shoulders sliding. Others writhed to the frenzied tempo, but Phoebe&#x2019;s hips beat out a slowed-down song. Punch-stained red cups split underfoot, opening into plastic petals. Palms open, she levitated both hands. The room clattered into motion, rising to spin. She dipped, glided along its tilt, and still she moved to the calm rhythm she&#x2019;d found, dragging the beat until my pulse joined hers.<br><br>She kept dancing, so I did, too. By the time she stopped, she looked flushed, out of breath. She lifted black, long hair into a makeshift ponytail. We shouted again, and I watched a drop of sweat trickle from Phoebe&#x2019;s hairline toward the clavicle niche, where it might pool, I thought, to be lapped up. Thick bangs, damp at the tips, parted to expose her forehead. I wanted to kiss that spot, its sudden openness: I leaned down. She pulled close.<br><br>Since then, three weeks ago, we talked; we kissed, but that was all. I didn&#x2019;t know what I had the right to ask. I waited, while the rest of Edwards played musical beds. Late at night, if I walked to the bathroom, I crossed paths with still more girls listing tipsily down the hall in oversized, borrowed polo shirts. They flashed smiles, then swerved back into my suitemates&#x2019; rooms. I returned to mine, but I could still hear the squeals, the high-pitched cries. In no time, a pretty girl might zigzag into my bed, and if it hadn&#x2019;t happened yet, it was excitingly attainable&#x2014;if I said the right words, reached for the right girl&#x2014;<br><br>Instead, on the nights I couldn&#x2019;t sleep, I imagined Phoebe&#x2019;s sidling hips, the fist-sized breasts. She flailed and squirmed. With an arched back, rosebud ass soaring up, she starred in solo fantasies. The fact that I still hadn&#x2019;t slept with Phoebe, or anyone, didn&#x2019;t preclude these scenarios. If anything, it helped. Irritation absolved me of the guilt I might have felt about the uses to which I put the spectral mouth and breasts. Each time this ghost Phoebe jumped in my lap, I bit her lips. I licked fingers; I grabbed fistfuls of made-up skin until, sometimes, when I saw the girl in the flesh, she looked as implausible as all the Phoebes I&#x2019;d dreamed into being.<br>________<br><br>I pushed through a revolving door into the Colonial: a private club, college-affiliated. She&#x2019;d invited me to have a drink. One last date, I&#x2019;d resolved. With Phoebe, I kept spending time I didn&#x2019;t have. I rushed from classes to Michelangelo&#x2019;s, an Italian restaurant fifteen miles from Noxhurst&#x2019;s town limits&#x2014;distant enough, I hoped, that no fellow students would walk in. I took the bus. I waited tables; I relied on staff meals. I filched apples from the Edwards dining hall. I received scholarship funding, but not enough. I told no one.<br><br>She was sitting alone at the bar, back facing out. I touched the girl&#x2019;s waist, and she slipped down from the stool. Phoebe&#x2019;s smile, angling up, floated toward me. She asked the bow-tied barkeep, Bix, to bring me a gimlet.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll love it, Will, she said. Bix makes, no joke, the world&#x2019;s best gimlets. He puts something extra in. I&#x2019;ve asked, but he won&#x2019;t tell me what it is.<br><br>If it was my recipe to give, I would, he said.<br><br>I believed him. It was obvious he liked Phoebe. She asked how I was, and I said I&#x2019;d passed a man playing the fiddle while I walked here. I&#x2019;d paused, to listen. I had no small bills, so I&#x2019;d put quarters in his upside-down hat. Oh, ho, he said. It&#x2019;s high-�rolling time. It&#x2019;s like jingle bells tonight.<br><br>He threw out the coins, I said, to Phoebe. I forced a smile, but I hadn&#x2019;t told the story well. I&#x2019;d tried to help him, all to be mocked. If I could just tell him as a gag, I&#x2019;d forget his ridicule. But then, as though she heard the version I intended, Phoebe obliged me, and laughed. She asked what I&#x2019;d said next. I rattled along. I was pleased; unsettled, too. It was odd, how well she listened. It made me anxious I&#x2019;d reveal more than I should. When I could, I turned the questions: an old evangelist&#x2019;s trick. In general, people love talking about themselves. If, at times, with Phoebe, I felt a slight resistance, I pushed through.<br><br>It&#x2019;s my first time in the Colonial, I said. I asked if she came here often. She explained the club&#x2019;s rituals and traditions, its complicated drinking-cup rules. A ghost-white candle stub guttered between us. I kept asking questions. I liked watching Phoebe talk. She halted, circled the point. Lit up with her own stories, she laughed in big gusts that blew out the candle flame. Bix relit it; before long, she put it out again.<br><br>You pass the cup around until it&#x2019;s finished, she said. The last person to drink upends it on his head. He spins it while people sing&#x2014;<br><br>She fell silent, gaze fixed to my left. I turned, but I noticed nothing unusual. Lilies splayed open on the windowsill, wilting stars. A tall man waited at the stoplight.<br><br>I thought I saw him again, she said.<br><br>Who?<br><br>His name&#x2019;s John Leal&#x2014;do you know him?<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think so.<br><br>No, it&#x2019;s nothing, she said. I just, I keep thinking I&#x2019;ve spotted him, but&#x2014;<br><br>Who is this?<br><br>Flustered, she tried to explain. Bix lit the candle, and she thanked him. It took a few tries, but, at last, I gathered she&#x2019;d gone to a club the other night, downtown. She stepped outside, phone in hand, to call a taxi. Someone else was also there, leaning against the wall. When she hung up, he hailed Phoebe by name. She didn&#x2019;t recognize him, but figured she was to blame. They&#x2019;d met. She&#x2019;d forgotten. To be polite, she played along, as if she knew him, but he ignored the act. I&#x2019;m John Leal, he said. You&#x2019;re Phoebe. I hoped I&#x2019;d run into you. I thought of how to set it up, and look, here you are.<br><br>Then, he listed small facts about her life. Trivial details, but nothing he should have known. He handed a folded note to Phoebe. I&#x2019;d love to see you again, he said. It&#x2019;s up to you, though. Call me when you&#x2019;re tired of wasting this life.<br><br>When you&#x2019;re tired of&#x2014;huh, I said.<br><br>Isn&#x2019;t it strange? Phoebe said. Oh, also, he had no shoes on. I thought, at first, that friends might be playing a practical joke on me. But it&#x2019;s not much of a joke.<br><br>She lifted a glass to Bix. From the level above us, male voices united in song, a capella. I asked if she intended to get in touch with this John Leal. No, but she wished she&#x2019;d asked how he knew what he did. She&#x2019;d kept the note, she said, pulling a slip from her wallet. It was a plain, lined, ripping along the fold. In block letters, he&#x2019;d printed his name. John Leal. I suggested she give him a call.<br><br>Why?<br><br>It&#x2019;s bothering you, I said. If you want, I&#x2019;ll help. I could see him with you.<br><br>Just then, a large man popped up behind Phoebe, sliding his hands across her eyes. Guess who, he said. He raised his arms. A full lilac robe spilled out from beneath his peacoat, a priest&#x2019;s white band at his throat. No, don&#x2019;t get up, he said. I&#x2019;ve left Liesl outside in the cold, and I told her I wouldn&#x2019;t be a minute but hello, Phoebe, don&#x2019;t you look tip-top. Tell me if you like this outfit. One of Liesl&#x2019;s friends is hosting a themed night: come as you aren&#x2019;t.</p><h2>Bold Moves for Schools: How We Create Remarkable Learning Environments</h2><p><p>How can educators transform old schools into remarkable learning environments?

With stunning before-and-after photos and testimonials providing motivation and inspiration, <i>Body&#x2013;</i>for<i>&#x2013;LIFE for Women </i>features a 12-week Mind-Mouth-Muscle eating, exercise, and emotional health program for women to help them achieve optimal health during their hormonal milestones.</p><p>It's not all about the jeans; flattening the tummy helps fight "Toxic Fat"--the disease-inducing weight Dr. Pamela Peeke teaches women how to conquer in <i>Body-for-LIFE for Women</i>.

Peeke strives to show her "girlfriends" <i>how</i> to accomplish these tasks, customizing plans for young and old. Clients' stories (including a 95-year-old who worked herself out of a wheelchair and into a martial arts class, and a 14-year old who replaced 90 lbs. of fat with a healthy load of self-confidence) lend credence to Peeke's 12-week weight reduction plan; so do the wowsie before-and-after pictures. Gender-specific scientific evidence supports Peeke's premise that women's bodies require different care than men's. But she doesn't stop there. <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><table> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Amazon.com Interview</b> <br> Read our interview with Pam Peeke. </td></tr> </tbody></table> </td></tr> </tbody></table> Peeke digs deeper for her audience, defining four hormonal milestones of a woman's life (menarche to beyond menopause) and customizing a physical and mental transformation plan to suit each. Easing off on strict calorie and weight guidelines, she focuses instead on serious fat reduction, muscle improvement, and practical suggestions for self-care. A handful of charts and formulae help readers assess their progress; sample exercises and fitness logs help, too. But for Peeke, weight reduction pales to bolstering a woman's self-worth through nurturing healthier habits. The only rough pill to swallow is Peeke's two-page list of smart foods: it lacks suggestions for turning acceptable proteins, carbohydrates and fats into palatable daily meals.<i>--Liane Thomas</i> <p></p><b>PAMELA PEEKE, MD, MPH, FACP, </b>is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and a Pew Foundation Scholar in nutrition and metabolism.

Life is not a sprint; it is a distance run, and it demands the kind of&nbsp;conditioning that enables people to go the distance.&#x201d;&#x2014;Gordon MacDonald&nbsp;<strong>Running Strong</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Whose heart doesn&#x2019;t leap at the sight of a beautifullyconditioned runner, effortlessly gliding along, stride-bystride,&nbsp;mile-by-mile? And what runner gets to this place without&nbsp;a thankless&#x2014;and often lonely&#x2014;regimen of strategy and self-denial?&nbsp;Isn&#x2019;t this the perfect metaphor of what your heart is longing for&#x2014;running&nbsp;life&#x2019;s race with intentionality and grace? With strength and focus?&nbsp;Well, you can. Veteran pastor and best-selling author Gordon MacDonald&nbsp;says you must develop resilience&#x2014;the courage and ability to get up when you fall,&nbsp;to keep running when you&#x2019;re bone-weary, and to keep your eye on the goal even in&nbsp;the murkiest moments. Using the backdrop of his own experiences as a champion&nbsp;runner, MacDonald demonstrates how resilient people&nbsp;<ul><li>Practice spiritual self-discipline to build stamina and grit;</li><li>Know what&#x2019;s up ahead, what obstacles they will likely face; and</li><li>Bond with special friends who share their commitment to finishing well.</li></ul>Because he has also run many long, punishing laps in the tough race of life,&nbsp;MacDonald is uniquely qualified to coach and encourage you in developing that&nbsp;resilient spirit&#x2014;to weather adversity, to finish what you start, and to never be&nbsp;satisfied with anything short of God&#x2019;s best for you.</p><p>Gordon MacDonald has been a pastor and author for more than fifty years.

His books includeBuilding Below the Waterline, Who Stole My Church, A Resilient Life, and Ordering Your Private World. Gordon and his wife, Gail, live in New Hampshire.Starred Review. MacDonald offers sage advice to Christians in middle age and beyond, asserting that the greatest contributions God has for believers come during the second half of life. The prolific author and pastor tells how a high school track coach instilled values that laid the foundations for effective adult living. This wizened man taught the teenage MacDonald principles that have stayed with him for a lifetime: run with vision, look backward only to learn from mistakes, cling to self-discipline while giving distance to self-indulgence and find satisfaction in joining with others to make great things happen. MacDonald (<i>Ordering Your Private World</i> and <i>The Life God Blesses</i>) listened well to his mentor and sadly realized that he had inherited a "quitter's gene" from his family. In this book, he characterizes resiliency as being committed to consistently finishing strong. Those who nurture a big-picture view of life, he says, leave the weight of the past behind, discipline themselves to go the distance and run with a "happy few" who best embody the truest expression of lasting friendship. MacDonald's guide to embracing resiliency is especially practical as he describes running the entire life race with gusto, urging fellow Christians to enlarge their minds, harness their emotions and trim their egos. With a passionate yet humble voice, MacDonald's self-help guide is a classic, riveting read. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Praying is an action that is of the essence of Christian existence. It involves our beliefs, emotions, values, hopes and fears, certainties and uncertainties, knowledge and ignorance. As J. I. Packer and Carolyn Nystrom explain, this book "is a heart-to-heart affair, in which two Christians who try to pray and wish they prayed better share thoughts about what they are doing with people whom they envisage as being like themselves. . . . Our aim is not just to clarify Christian understanding but to foster Christian living. In real praying, head, heart and hands go together." With wisdom, humility and sincerity the authors lead us through different moods of praying, including brooding, praising, asking, complaining and hanging on. In <em>Praying</em> the authors offer hope for those of us who daydream when we try to listen to God and stumble when we try to speak. Yet they don't just teach us about prayer; they challenge and inspire us to do it by pointing us to a clearer realization of the reality of God and his character. Let Packer and Nystrom come alongside you to encourage and guide your active praying to our powerful God, and let him move your praying through mere duty to delight.</p><p>Features &amp; Benefits <p>* Includes reflection and study questions, prayer exercises, and journaling suggestions for each chapter</p><p>* An excellent tool for group or personal study</p><strong>J.

Born in Harlem to Dominican parents, she was sent to live with her maternal grandparents in the Para�so (Paradise) district in Santo Domingo while still a baby. It proved to be an idyllic reprieve in her otherwise fraught childhood. Para�so came to mean family, home, belonging. When Cepeda returned to the US, she discovered her family constellation had changed. Her mother had a new, abusive boyfriend, who relocated the family to San Francisco. When that relationship fell apart, Cepeda found herself back in New York City with her father and European stepmother: attending tennis lessons and Catholic schools; fighting vicious battles with her father, who discouraged her from expressing the Dominican part of her hyphenated identity; and immersed in the &#x2019;80s hip-hop culture of uptown Manhattan. It was in these streets, through the prism of hip-hop and the sometimes loving embrace of her community, that Cepeda constructed her own identity.<br> <br>Years later, when Cepeda had become a successful journalist and documentary filmmaker, the strands of her DNA would take her further, across the globe and into history. Who were her ancestors? How did they&#x2014;and she&#x2014;become Latina? Her journey, as the most unforgettable ones often do, would lead her to places she hadn&#x2019;t expected to go. With a vibrant lyrical prose and fierce honesty, Cepeda parses concepts of race, identity, and ancestral DNA among Latinos by using her own Dominican-American story as one example, and in the process arrives at some sort of peace with her father.</p><p>Raquel Cepeda is an award-winning journalist, cultural activist, and documentary filmmaker. A former magazine editor, her byline has appeared in <i>The Village Voice, CNN.com,</i> the Associated Press, and many others.

Ah, <i>that&#x2019;s</i> the great puzzle.<br> <br>&#x2014;LEWIS CARROLL, <i>ALICE IN WONDERLAND</i><br> <br>AS I WRITE THIS, MY THREE-MONTH-OLD SON IS STARING AT ME intensely from his bouncy seat. He&#x2019;s cooing loudly, like he&#x2019;s trying to tell me something important, something he&#x2019;ll forget by the time he utters his first word. Marceau has been here before. Of this, I am sure.<br> <br>The left half of our brains, programmed to think that seeing is believing, would dismiss this kind of thinking as esoteric new age bullshit. However, there&#x2019;s the other half that can&#x2019;t dismiss the idea that there just might be something to it. Many of us have recognized old souls in babies and children. We&#x2019;ve felt the presence of some force, be it a spiritual guide or God, intervening in our lives at some point. When I look over at my son in his bouncer, I&#x2019;m reminded of what a rabbi in Brooklyn, a seer in Fez, and a santero in Queens told me with slight variation when I was writing this book. We travel with the same clan over and over again, from one life into the next, until some ultimate purpose is fulfilled and we no longer need to return. When we illuminate the road back to our ancestors, they have a way of reaching out, of manifesting themselves . . . sometimes even physically.<br> <br>Last year I embarked on an archaeological dig of sorts, using the science of ancestral DNA testing to excavate as many parts of my genetic history as I could in the span of twelve months. The DNA kits I collected were processed by Family Tree DNA, a Houston-based commercial genetic genealogy company. The company&#x2019;s founder and CEO, Bennett Greenspan, provided further analysis. I tested myself, my father, a paternal great-uncle I hadn&#x2019;t met until the beginning of my project, and a maternal cousin I found on Facebook. I wanted to learn as much as I could about my ancestors&#x2019; origins <i>before</i> we became Latino.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve always been intrigued by the concept of race, especially in my own community and immediate family, where it&#x2019;s been a source of contention for as long as I can remember. The United States has the second highest Latino population in the world, second only to Mexico. And still, the media&#x2014;they lump us all together into one generic clod&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t get us, either. Are Latino-Americans white? Black? Other? Illegal aliens from Mars? Or are we the very face of America?<br> <br>Some see Latinos as the embodiment of this young country&#x2019;s cultural melting pot. And though Mexicans have been residing here since before the arrival of the first Europeans, many of our fellow Americans view Latinos as public enemies. What our parents see isn&#x2019;t necessarily what we first- and second-generation American-born Latinos see when looking at ourselves in the mirror. According to the 2010 census, over half of all Latinos here identified as being solely white, and about a third checked &#x201c;Some Other Race.&#x201d; I was one of the three million, or 6 percent, who reported being of multiple races. I guess it all depends on whom you ask and when you ask. Race, I&#x2019;ve learned, is in the eye of the beholder.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t look all the way white or all the way Black; I look like someone who&#x2019;s a bit of both and then some&#x2014;an <i>Other.</i> In Europe, people have mistaken me for Andalusian, Turkish, Brazilian, and North African. In North and West Africa, I&#x2019;ve been asked if I&#x2019;m of Arabic or Amazigh descent. In New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, it varies: Israeli or Sephardic, Palestinian, Moroccan, biracial Black and white American, Brazilian, and so on. I&#x2019;ve been mistaken for being everything except what I am: Dominican. My own racial ambiguity has been a topic of conversation since I was a teenager. Blending in has filled the pages in my book of life with misadventures and the kind of culturally enriching experiences that make me feel, truly, like a world citizen.<br> <br>In more recent times, I found the idea that we live in a so-called post-racial society downright fascinating. I suspect someone at the White House or Disney created that catchphrase after the election of President Barack Obama, to fool us into thinking we&#x2019;re now living in a parallel universe where race is suddenly a nonfactor. The term &#x201c;post-racial&#x201d; is an epic failure. More than four years after the fact, our first Black president&#x2019;s skin tone is still getting people punch-drunk with hate. It has fueled the dramatic rise in hate groups and the revival of the so-called Patriot movement. Sure, our sucky-ass economy factors in to the foaming-at-the-mouth vitriol against President Obama, but there&#x2019;s something else contributing to the mainstream&#x2019;s arrogant contempt for him. As intangible and trivial as our differences are, we cannot pretend that race doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore.<br> <br>The exploration of and how we choose to identify ourselves is something else that compelled me to set upon this journey. Our identities are as fluid as our personal experiences are diverse. How I arrived at my own is one of 50.5 million possibilities. While Latino-Americans share enough cultural traditions to relate with one another and whatnot, we are also crazy different. One size doesn&#x2019;t fit all. That&#x2019;s why Part I of this book is a memoir. I grew up in a household where I was discouraged from celebrating, much less expressing, the Dominican half of my hyphenated identity. I was, quite frankly, sweated hard to mask it. In the first part of the book, I detail how I resisted the pressure to bend and how I constructed my own identity. My parents&#x2019; Dominican roots, my father&#x2019;s apparent low self-esteem and hatred, &#x2019;80s hip-hop culture, and growing up in my beloved New York City are all significant.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The results of our ancestral DNA tests are outlined in Part II.<br> <br>Both of my parents were born close to the site of the first European settlement in the Americas, Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispaniola. The Indigenous people we now refer to as Ta�nos&#x2014;they stumbled upon and were subsequently duped by Columbus and his crew&#x2014;originally inhabited the island. Our eastern part of the island is also the wellspring of blackness in the New World (and the site of the first slave rebellion on record). Modern-day Dominican Republic is also where English pirates, Europeans, crypto-Jews and Muslims, Arabs, Asians, our Haitian counterparts, and people from all over the world contributed to the cultural and racial tapestry of her people. With this in mind, I had absolutely no idea what I would find in my own DNA.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll share one of the results here. What I didn&#x2019;t expect to find, other than in spirit, was a direct link to the Indigenous peoples of the island. I&#x2019;ve been taught over the years that the Spanish, through disease and genocide via slavery, killed off virtually all Ta�no people throughout the Caribbean; they basically do not exist and are figments of our self-loathing imagination. When I saw an episode in Henry Louis Gates, Jr.&#x2019;s series <i>Black in Latin America</i> focusing on the Dominican Republic and Haiti, I heard it again.<br> <br>The documentary opened with Gates mistakenly calling a Cuban <i>guaguanc�</i> a Dominican merengue (the mistake was later corrected). While I tried not to see that musical snafu as an omen of things to come, I couldn&#x2019;t help but brace myself. I was certain that Gates, a man who&#x2019;s become famous for connecting celebrities with their ancestral past, would shed some light on the complexities of identity and race in the Dominican Republic. I thought he would wax poetic on how racially diverse we are and how, thanks to ancestral DNA studies being done on the island, we are finding that significant numbers of people carry indigenous mitochondrial DNA. <i>Indios</i> have, alas, found ways to survive, like everything else on the island&#x2014;in fragments.<br> <br>As Gates strolled down <i>Calle Conde</i> with an employee from the Ministry of Culture named Juan Rodriguez, he asked the man how he&#x2019;d be identified or racially categorized on the island. Rodriguez, a dark-caramel-complected man, replied, &#x201c;<i>indio.</i>&#x201d; Rodriguez went on to state that by the nineteenth century, there were no more Indigenous people left on the island like there were in South America, so Dominicans used the term to negate their blackness. Yeah, I know many <i>dominicanos</i> and other Latinos who deny their blackness, but the conversation could have been pushed further by exploring the reasons <i>why,</i> adding to the complex narrative about race and identity in our community. It would have been less archaic. A conversation with younger Dominicans and transnational Dominican-Americans about how and why these ideals are shifting would have been less archaic. That cipher never went down.<br> <br>At the time of this writing, the Dominican government has passed a bill called the Dominican Republic Electoral Law Reform, eradicating the term <i>indio</i> on its citizens&#x2019; ID cards. The categories mulatto, black, and white will be the only ones people will have to choose from. I find it troubling that if I wish to officially recognize the Indigenous fragment of myself, it won&#x2019;t be legal. Foisting an identity on people rather than allowing them the freedom and space to create their own is shady.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Henry Miller, in his book <i>Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch,</i> wrote: &#x201c;One&#x2019;s destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.&#x201d; This journey&#x2014;as the most unforgettable ones often do&#x2014;led me to places I hadn&#x2019;t expected to go. The skeleton of this book is my exploration of the concept of race, identity, and ancestral DNA among Latinos, using my own story as one example. Race and identity have been a source of bitterness between my father and me since before I can remember. How I arrived at some sort of understanding and peace with Dad, something that never would have happened had I not invited him to take this trip with me, is the proverbial meat on the bones. I look over at Marceau, thankful that this illuminating ride has stopped here, in a place where <i>logos</i> and <i>mythos</i> exist in tandem, guiding me from one place to another with purpose.</p><h2>The Next Worship: Glorifying God in a Diverse World</h2><p><ul><li>Christianity Today's 2017 Book of the Year Award of Merit - Church/Pastoral Leadership</li></ul> What happens when a diverse church glorifies the global God? We live in a time of unprecedented intercultural exchange, where our communities welcome people from around the world. Music and media from every culture are easily accessible, and our worship is infused with a rich variety of musical and liturgical influences. But leading worship in multicultural contexts can be a crosscultural experience for everybody. How do we help our congregations navigate the journey? Innovative worship leader Sandra Maria Van Opstal is known for crafting worship that embodies the global, multiethnic body of Christ. Likening diverse worship to a sumptuous banquet, she shows how worship leaders can set the table and welcome worshipers from every tribe and tongue. Van Opstal provides biblical foundations for multiethnic worship, with practical tools and resources for planning services that reflect God's invitation for all peoples to praise him. When multiethnic worship is done well, the church models reconciliation and prophetic justice, heralding God's good news for the world. Enter into the praise of our king, and let the nations rejoice!</p><p>Sandra Maria Van Opstal is a Chicago-born, second-generation Latina and a leading practitioner of multiethnic worship. She was worship director for the Urbana Student Missions Conference and regularly serves as a worship leader and mission trainer with Christian colleges, conferences and local churches. She is a pastor at The Grace and Peace Community in Chicago and is the author of <em>The Mission of Worship</em>.<br><br>Mark Labberton is president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He previously served as Lloyd John Ogilvie chair for preaching and director of the Lloyd John Ogilvie Institute for Preaching. Labberton came to Fuller after sixteen years as senior pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, California. He has served as chair of John Stott Ministries (now Langham Partnership) and co-chair of the John Stott Ministries Global Initiative Fund. Today he continues to contribute to the mission of the global church as a senior fellow of International Justice Mission. He is the author of <em>The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor</em> and <em>The Dangerous Act of Worship</em>."<em>The Next Worship</em> is an important book for our increasingly diverse church. Writing as a practitioner and theologian, Sandra Van Opstal employs the extended metaphor of the table to describe the rich fellowship of diverse worship. Drawing on deep biblical study and years of personal experience, Van Opstal moves us to stand with our diverse congregations in postures of hospitality ('we welcome you'), solidarity ('we stand with you') and mutuality ('we need you'). Not at all na�ve, this book acknowledges the tensions and challenges of diverse worship as well as its opportunities. Van Opstal skillfully guides us through processes of change, the necessity of shared leadership and the challenges and joys of training other leaders for this task. This is a needed book, not only by worship leaders but also by pastors, elders and every Christian who longs to enter into and to rehearse the ultimate diverse worship of the new heavens and the new earth." (Steven C. Roy, associate professor of pastoral theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"All Christians are on a journey toward God's multicultural kingdom. We live in a remarkable time of opportunity for growth in understanding and shared practices across cultures. Drawing on years of creative leadership in a variety of contexts, Sandra Van Opstal offers us testimonies, tools and insights to inform the next steps in our own journeys of growth and sanctification. May God use this book to break down barriers and strengthen intercultural bonds of many worshiping communities!" (John Witvliet, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, Calvin College and Calvin Theological Seminary)<br><br>"What Sandra Van Opstal does so importantly here is to help make the arc of this worship transformation clear and practicable. Out of her life experience and rich ministry background, Sandra does for us here what she has done over the years for many of those she has led as worship teams and as worshipers. This book is a vital gift for a changing church that needs to reflect the God of all the nations." (From the foreword by Mark Labberton, president, Fuller Theological Seminary, author, The Dangerous Act of Worship)<br><br>"<em>The Next Worship</em> argues persuasively that achieving unity in worship requires taking diversity seriously. At once prophetic and pastoral, the book presents a set of principles for navigating the complexities of race, ethnicity and culture within congregational worship. Van Opstal calls worship leaders to be anthropologists as well as theologians: self-aware students of culture who engage in critical reflection about their contexts, who take responsibility for interpreting their actions and who summon the courage and humility to truly collaborate. Van Opstal's writing models her leadership strategy&#x2015;accounts from her own experience through the years are enriched by perspectives from a number of key leaders and scholars. Though its account is ultimately hopeful, the book does not downplay the difficulties inherent in building worshiping congregations across lines of cultural difference. Rather, it shows that coming together across these differences will frequently lead to tension, discomfort and sometimes pain. A commitment to working together through these issues is key to developing the kinds of relationships that characterize the coming kingdom. <em>The Next Worship</em> makes a compelling argument that building worshipping communities across lines of division cannot be a niche interest. Rather, engaging diverse perspectives and learning to share authority must become priorities for all Christ-followers interested in the continued life and health of the church." (Monique Ingalls, professor of church music, Baylor University)<br><br>"We have lost the language of love in our worship&#x2015;love for God and love for our neighbor. This is a book for those who want to recover these loves by practicing reconciliation in worship. <em>The Next Worship</em> shows us how to love God and love our neighbor practically in worship, specifically by sharing leadership and guiding others in change. Through her personal relationships and experience in community Sandra teaches us to create spaces of hospitality, solidarity and mutuality through worship. I highly recommend this book, having experienced Sandra's leadership and knowing the wealth she has crossing cultures domestically and globally." (John Perkins, cofounder, CCDA, founder, John and Vera Mae Perkins Foundation)<br><br>"For those of us who are committed to the work of Christian community development in vulnerable neighborhoods, being rooted in a faith community with an expression of worship that is rooted in our struggle for justice and reconciliation is essential. Sandra's new book, <em>The Next Worship: Glorifying God in a Diverse World</em>, provides a much-needed resource for leaders who are committed to crafting worship experiences rooted in diversity." (Noel Castellanos, CEO and president, CCDA)<br><br>"One of most significant challenges for the next era of evangelicalism is developing unity in the worship life of a multicultural Christian community. Sandra Van Opstal recognizes that multicultural worship is a long journey with many bumps along the way&#x2015;there are no simple and easy answers. In <em>The Next Worship</em>, Sandra puts forth key principles and helpful models that should inspire us to pursue this noble goal. This book may well become the essential text that helps multiethnic churches turn the corner in their worship life." (Soong-Chan Rah, Milton B. Engebretson Professor of Church Growth and Evangelism, North Park Theological Seminary, author of The Next Evangelicalism and Prophetic Lament)<br><br>"If we worship leaders are taking our pastoral roles seriously, one of our jobs is to prepare our churches for heaven's worship where all nations are gathered. This book inspires, encourages and teaches how to do just that!" (Zac Hicks, recording artist, pastor of worship at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, Ft. Lauderdale, FL)<br><br>"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lamented that one of the most segregated hours is eleven o'clock on Sunday morning, when the church gathers for worship. Sandra Van Opstal offers a fresh vision where the church reflects the diversity of God's kingdom rather than conforming to the patterns of segregation. The Next Worship reminds us that unity is not about uniformity, but about harmonizing rather than homogenizing. Van Opstal reminds us that what may be just as important as how we worship is who we worship with. This is a beautiful book." (Shane Claiborne, author and activist, codirector, Red Letter Christians, founder, The Simple Way)<br><br>"While acknowledging that inclusive worship will look different in each congregational context, <em>The Next Worship</em> shows how we can move toward gathered worship that 'points to the future celebration of God's people from every tribe, tongue, people and language.' Besides being full of stories acknowledging the challenges of multiethnic worship, this immensely practical volume also provides hope and how-to advice for preparing (sometimes reluctant) congregations to worship in ways that connect them with the global church in their community and abroad. In a refreshingly broad approach, Sandra Van Opstal goes beyond discussions of music styles to explore what multiethnic worship might look like in Scripture reading, prayers, other arts, the Lord's Supper, the teaching of the Word and more. Furthermore, her own rich experience in mentoring worship leaders has given her keen insight regarding collaborative service planning and the development of diverse worship leadership. The summaries of key concepts at the end of each chapter along with probing questions for reflection and discussion make this a vital resource for pastors, worship leaders, worship planning committees and training programs."

Having accrued considerable wealth through a long career of crime&#x2015;forgery, extortion, serial murder&#x2015;Ripley still finds his appetite unquenched and longs to get back in the game.</p><p>In <em>Ripley's Game</em>, first published in 1974, Patricia Highsmith's classic chameleon relishes the opportunity to simultaneously repay an insult and help a friend commit a crime&#x2015;and escape the doldrums of his idyllic retirement. This third novel in Highsmith's series is one of her most psychologically nuanced&#x2015;particularly memorable for its dark, absurd humor&#x2015;and was hailed by critics for its ability to manipulate the tropes of the genre. With the creation of Ripley, one of literature's most seductive sociopaths, Highsmith anticipated the likes of Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter years before their appearance.</p></p><p>Connoisseur of art, harpsichord aficionado, gardener extraordinaire, and genius of improvisational murder, the inimitable Tom Ripley finds his complacency shaken when he is scorned at a posh gala. While an ordinary psychopath might repay the insult with some mild act of retribution, what Ripley has in mind is far more subtle, and infinitely more sinister. A social slight doesn&#39;t warrant murder of course-- just a chain of events that may lead to it.Patricia Highsmith (1921&#x2013;1995) was the author of more than twenty novels, including Strangers on a Train, The Price of Salt,&nbsp;The Blunderer and The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as numerous short stories.</p><h2>Instant Vocabulary</h2><p><b>LEARNING NEW WORDS IS AS EASY AS ONE, TWO, THREE!</b> <br><br> <b>� RECOGNIZE</b> the keys to the English language, the basic units from which all words are made <br> <b>� FOLLOW</b> clear examples of how the key explains a word's origin and meaning -- or how it combines with other keys to create new words <br> <b>� BUILD</b> your word power with practical exercises to expand and integrate your knowledge, without memorization <br><br> Why enroll in an expensive course when everything you need to increase your vocabulary is at your fingertips?

Created by SHAPE America &#x2014; Society of Health and Physical Educators (formerly AAHPERD) &#x2014; this text unveils the new National Standards for K-12 Physical Education. The standards and text have been retooled to support students&#x2019; holistic development. </p><p> This is the third iteration of the National Standards for K-12 Physical Education, and this latest version features two prominent changes: </p><p> � <b>The term <i>physical literacy</i> underpins the standards.</b> It encompasses the three domains of physical education (psychomotor, cognitive, and affective) and considers not only physical competence and knowledge but also attitudes, motivation, and the social and psychological skills needed for participation. </p><p> � <b>Grade-level outcomes support the national physical education standards.</b> These measurable outcomes are organized by level (elementary, middle, and high school) and by standard. They provide a bridge between the new standards and K-12 physical education curriculum development and make it easy for teachers to assess and track student progress across grades, resulting in physically literate students. </p><p> In developing the grade-level outcomes, the authors focus on motor skill competency, student engagement and intrinsic motivation, instructional climate, gender differences, lifetime activity approach, and physical activity. All outcomes are written to align with the standards and with the intent of fostering lifelong physical activity. </p><p><i>National Standards &amp; Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education</i> presents the standards and outcomes in ways that will help preservice teachers and current practitioners plan curricula, units, lessons, and tasks. The text also </p><p> � empowers physical educators to help students meet the Common Core standards; </p><p> � allows teachers to see the new standards and the scope and sequence for outcomes for all grade levels at a glance in a colorful, easy-to-read format; and </p><p> � provides administrators, parents, and policy makers with a framework for understanding what students should know and be able to do as a result of their physical education instruction. </p><p> The result is a text that teachers can confidently use in creating and enhancing high-quality programs that prepare students to be physically literate and active their whole lives. </p></p><p><p><b>SHAPE America &#x2014; Society of Health and Physical Educators (formerly AAHPERD)</b> &#x2014; is the largest organization of physical educators in the country, with close to 20,000 members. SHAPE America created the first-ever K-12 physical education national standards; developed the Let&#x2019;s Move in School public awareness campaign to increase physical activity before, during, and after school; and originated the <i>Shape of the Nation Report</i>, which reviews the status of physical education across the United States. Among its many partners, SHAPE America works with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, the American Heart Association, The Cooper Institute, First Lady Michelle Obama&#x2019;s Let&#x2019;s Move! initiative, and the President&#x2019;s Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition. </p></p><h2>Child Development and Education plus MyLab Education with Pearson eText -- Access Card Package (Myeducationlab)</h2><p><b>NOTE: </b>Before purchasing, check with your instructor to ensure you select the correct ISBN.

Each spread shows her announcing, Time to sleep, which is followed by a character's name. Cat's pals all appear midway through a familiar step in the process. Sheep is reading, Pig is in the tub, Giraffe is brushing her teeth, Crab is getting a glass of water, Horse is on the toilet, and Shark is choosing a stuffed toy. Only Owl is not ready to go to bed, and young readers will delight in letting everyone know why. As the animals drift off, Owl is left on a perch, watching over them. The real magic of this title is in Willems's illustrations. The spread with Cat and Horse in the bathroom has Cat with a pink blush on her cheeks, toes pointed inward with her right foot stacked on top of her left, and her tail is in a knot. The message of embarrassment is simple and clear. On the spread with Shark, piled among the stuffed animals is Pigeon. These are the details that children will relish and will lead them to invest in the characters and in the series. <i>Stacy Dillon, LREI, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Brett Milano dives deep into the piles of old vinyl to uncover the subculture of record collecting. A vinyl junkie is not the person who has a few old 45s shoved in the cuboard from their days in high school. Vinyl Junkies are the people who will travel over 3,000 miles to hear a rare b-side by a German band that has only recorded two songs since 1962, vinyl junkies are the people who own every copy of every record produced by the favorite artist from every pressing and printing in existance, vinyl junkies are the people who may just love that black plastic more than anything else in their lives. Brett Milano traveled the U.S. seeking out the most die-hard and fanatical collectors to capture all that it means to be a vinyl junkie. Includes interviews with Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Peter Buck from R.E.M and Robert Crumb, creator of Fritz the cat and many more underground comics.</p></p><p><p><b>Brett Milano</b> is a longtime Boston-based music journalist who once interviewed Joey Ramone and Barry Manilow on the same day.

He has written for <i>Billboard, Pulse</i> and the <i>College Media Journal</i>; and can now be read weekly in the <i>Boston Herald </i>and the <i>Boston Phoenix</i>. Aside from a short-lived <i>Boston Rock Trivia</i> volume that still turns up on Ebay to this day, <i>Vinyl Junkies</i> is his first book.</p>Vinyl Junkies <br> CHAPTER ONE THE SCYTHIAN " <i>Give him</i> the Scythian!" shouts Monoman from across the room. Pat waves his hand with a proper flourish: Nope, I'm not ready for the Scythian yet. We'll just have to build up to it. I'm sitting in a record-crowded apartment in the Boston suburbs, staring directly at a few hundred thousand dollars' worth of stereo equipment. Pat's stereo is nearly as eclectic as his record collection, which includes--just taking in the ones within eyesight--the Who, Doris Day, Tammy Wynette, Motorhead, Tom Jones, and Henry Mancini; this is a sensibility well beyond any standard notions of what's hip. The stereo is evidence of one man's quest for the perfect sound. The turntable is Pat's pick of the three dozen he's got in his house: suspendedon air and perfectly calibrated to be vibration-free, it's designed to make sure that no small disturbances--like, say, an earthquake or a nuclear detonation--interfere with the listening experience. The turntable was made by a stereo buff in New Hampshire, the tone arm came from Germany and cost another few grand. There are pillowcases stuffed into the corners of the ceiling to keep those precious soundwaves inside. Then there's the piece of wood. "Don't forget that piece of wood," his assistant Jeff, a.k.a. Monoman, points out. Sure enough, it's a piece of wood: cut in the shape of a beehive with a hole in the middle, it screws on top of the center hole to make sure those dreaded vibrations don't get through--according to Jeff, "The only good vibrations come from the Beach Boys." The piece of wood cost a grand on its own, but as Pat assures us, "It's a really good piece of wood." &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> <i>I'd already</i> had some of my best record-listening experiences on the crummiest stereos ever made. Stereo isn't even quite the right term--that thing I owned as a kid was more accurately a record player, a phonograph, maybe even a Victrola, but I believe the technical term we're looking for is "piece of crap": there was exactly one speaker, approximately the size of that little "O" you'd make if you closed your thumb and forefinger; and the needle tracked at something like two pounds, enough to cause instant damage to every record it touched. But it did go impossibly loud, and for ears trained on '60s AM radio, that was enough. The first record I rememberplaying on it was "She Loves You" by the Beatles, and it came out with that AM-radio sound: those harmonies at the start of the song sounded like a jet taking off. Which, culturally speaking, is exactly what they were. And when I later heard the same song under more desirable circumstances--on vinyl on a proper system; then on the CD reissue--it never had that compressed, unnatural sound that I always took for part of the recording. By the time I was thirteen, I owned what I thought was a luxury stereo. It was made by Magnavox, just like my parents' TV set. The speakers folded out, and the little turntable could be closed up into the player; it was a "portable" stereo that weighed close to fifty pounds. Unlike my childhood monstrosity, this one didn't ruin your records until the second or third play. You also had the option of ruining your records instantly by stacking them on the changer, where they'd be scraped by the changer-holder on top and by other records on the bottom. By now my musical tastes had become more refined, or so I thought at the time--Iwas deeply into Yes, Genesis, and their progressive-rock brethren. I'm still willing to argue till closing time about those bands' musical merits, but one thing is certain: their albums were incredibly detailed, full of sonic textures and mellotron overdubs--exactly what my introverted teenage ears were looking for. At this point, records weren't something I played over dinner or with company: I wanted to <i>experience</i> all those deep, layered sounds. Armed with my Magnavox power station and a pair of weighty headphones that made your ears throb after the first album side, I listened intently enough to catch them all. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> <i>But now</i> I'm hoping to get my mind blown in Brookline, to get the high-velocity sound I dreamed of back in my old bedroom. My guides for this trip are well known in the loose-knit community of Northeast collectors. Pat runs Looney Tunes, a used-record store that sits within the high-rent vicinity of the Berklee College of Music. The place's very existence looks like a slap at Starbuck's, Barnes &amp; Noble, and the other upscale, uniform chains that fill up the same block. But there are enough Berklee-ites who are glad to snap up the vintage jazz and soul vinyl that clutters up the place--though they'd probably be a little spooked if they knew that their record's previous owner is likely as not to be six feet under. More than once has the widow of a collector made a call to Pat and his pickup truck; his unofficial motto is "You die, we buy." Sometimes the collections survive, but the marriage dies. Pat's been there when disgruntled wives have hit their husbands with the dreaded line, "It's me or the records." That's the cue for the husband to make his stand in front of the turntable, the wife to storm out, and Pat to go home empty-handed. Big and gregarious, with a Southern accent that he's maintained through decades in the Northeast, Pat was drinking martinis and name-dropping the Rat Pack before it became a trend. "This is obviously the house of somebody with a problem," he notes, surveying the unfiled discs that take up every bit of floor and shelf space. But unlike the stereotypical record collector--the hyper-geeky type most recently seen in a dark attic in the film <i>Ghost World--</i>Pat doesn't shut himselfaway with his vinyl. He has girlfriends, eats barbeque, and has used record-collecting as an excuse to travel. For him, collecting is an intrinsic part of the good life. He's fond of quoting the line "Music frees your mind from the tyranny of conscious thought." Monoman is unkempt, eccentric, and the leader of the best rock 'n' roll band I've ever seen. The long-standing nickname refers both to his love of monaural sound and to his relentless single-rnindedness. The name has changed spellings over the years: On a 1978 album with his first band, DMZ, he was Mono Mann. More recently, he fell in love with Japanese cartoons and briefly re-christened himself Pokemonoman. His current band, the Lyres, has been together twenty-two years and shows no signs of either slowing down or changing in the slightest degree. They take their cue from '6os garage punk, the three-chord stomp that was invented by countless teens who took "Louie Louie" as their gospel. In fact, Jeff learned many Lyres's songs by scouring the globe for obscure '60s singles, paying up to a grand for an original 45. But I'd doubt that a lot of those teenage '60s bands, hormone-driven though they were, could ever match this one on an especially hot or especially drunk night. He has destroyed instruments and friendships onstage: once he fired the drummer in the middle of the show (the drummer then got pissed off enough to play the set of his life). But he's just as likely to hit you with something truly soulful; the signature Lyres song, "Don't Give It Up Now," has gotten me through more than one crisis of faith. I once saw him earnestly explain to an audience that he wasn't in it for the money: "That's why we're playingthis crappy club for all of you cheap assholes!" There's been times when you'd swear that he's bypassed the tyranny of conscious thought altogether. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> <i>Today Pat's</i> commandeered the turntable while Monoman is sinking into a couch, welcoming the chance to blow off his part-time gig cataloging records for Pat's shop. The first thing he has in store is a Doris Day record. "Why that one?" I ask. "Because it was on top of the pile, and I like it," Pat explains. First he makes sure I'm positioned in the "sweet spot," where all eight of the speakers are facing me in equal proportions. Then he advises me to lean back and keep my eyes closed. Finally he sets the needle down, making sure not to turn the volume up until it's landed. And I sit back waiting to hear the heavens open. Instead, all I hear is Doris Day. On this particular record--a 1962 set with Andre Previn and his jazz trio--she does sound more sultry than her wholesome legend would have it. Between her alleged sexuality and the suggestive winks in a few of her hits, she could have been the Madonna of her time--go on, give "Teacher's Pet" and "Pillow Talk" another listen. Still, I'm getting no great revelations from this disc, other than that forty years of scratches add up to a whole lot of surface noise. When the drummer kicks in, it does sound as if the drumset was right there in the room. But as someone who sees live music a few times a week, I've been in enough real rooms with real drumsets that it's no big deal. And sorry,but neither is Doris Day. She may be close to sultry and modern on this record, but not quite close enough. So far I'm not impressed. Neither is Monoman, who only looks up from his magazine long enough to note that "It's good to listen to things that aren't rock. That just makes the rock sound so much better." Like many rock-eared collectors, the three of us grew up at the mercy of our parents' musical tastes. Fortunately, mine were savvy enough to slip in the occasional gem like Ravel's "Bolero," whose primal rhythms would be the first that spoke to me--even now I'm impressed that I was able to sit through fifteen minutes of it at such a young age. For Monoman, it was show tunes: he first got the beat in "76 Trombones." From there it was '60s AM radio. "I loved the Dave Clark Five because they had the organ," he recalls. "I had a fit when I was five because I didn't get an organ for Christmas. So I ruined Christmas for everybody, and I damn well got a piano next year." So if Doris Day can't open my ears, maybe some of that '60s music can. Pat first pulls out a cult classic, <i>The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands,</i> and picks out the track called "I'm Chief Kamanawanalea." Yep, that one sure brings back memories of how much fun it was to shout the title at high school parties. (You can get the joke by saying "Kamanawanalea" out loud, but it's truly not worth it.) Not quite the stuff of audio nirvana, however. Okay, Pat goes for the heavy artillery: a pristine copy of the mono edition of the Beatles's <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i> He carefully slides thedisc--with the original, sleek black U.K. Parlophone label--out of the jacket and cues up, of all things, "She's Leaving Home." Not that one, I plead, I hate that song. "Wait till you hear it in mono," he promises. "Just check out the Lennon harmonies." Nope, still hate it. But at least I've just learned why some vinyl diehards are sticklers for mono sound: with a good mono mix, the music sounds complete, as if it's all being pumped from the same heart. And John's chorus counterpoints are indeed louder in this version, always a plus. None of which is enough to keep this tearjerker of Paul's from being one of the small handful of Beatles songs that I just can't deal with. Mono Beatles albums have a cachet in the collector's market, in part because they're so scarce--stereo was no longer just a luxury item by the time the Beatles split up- and, because at this point, any newly-mined variation on a Beatles record is to be treasured. In the case of <i>Sgt. Pepper,</i> there are certain vocal bits--like a spoken rant by Paul right before "A Day in the Life"--that got mixed into oblivion on the stereo version. Beyond the collector's value, vinyl junkies detect a richness and warmth in mono records of this era, something to bring you closer to the sound of the period, to hearing the record in its original context. For a time Monoman refused to listen to anything else, and he still spends an inordinate amount of time and money questing for original editions of '60s singles, and he won't allow his Lyres to perform a '60s song unless an original copy is sitting in his collection. Mostrecently a European dealer sent him a tape of a little-known single and he fired back three hundred dollars for it--even though the music itself was already there on the tape. But it's about something more than just hearing a song: "Those original pressings are what you need to bring you closer to the original event." So are collectors just looking for a great musical experience like everyone else, though maybe with more fervor? Not quite. Because there's an element of fetishism in this as well, and it gets unleashed when Pat pulls out that vintage <i>Pepper.</i> Ninety percent of the people in the world would register an album cover they've seen a million times and move on. Not the case here: the picture may be the same, but the plastic lamination is different. "Whoa!" Monoman leaps from his chair. "I've never seen that one before." "Pretty unusual, isn't it?" Pat says. "The cover doesn't feel as heavily embossed as usual." Here's where we get into the deep details. Old Bob Dylan records, for example, have distinguishing marks on the labels. You can spot a first pressing by an indent around the edge of the label itself (and collectors swear you'll be rewarded with a better-sounding copy). The date of this <i>Pepper</i> is more elusive: maybe in the '70s, when some new cardboard stock came into the pressing plants? But doesn't the record itself sound closer to that desirable first pressing? The mystery isn't about to get solved, and the original owner isn't around to clear it up. When you start wondering about the personal history of a disc you've just acquired, you're getting close to the point of no return. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> <i>Time is</i> wasting, however, and I still haven't had my mind blown. "Give him the Scythian!" Monoman yells. Not quite. Pat has one more trick up his sleeve. This time it's Louis Armstrong. The disc is <i>Satchmo Plays King Oliver,</i> a 1962 release on the Audio Fidelity label. It's theoretically from the dark ages, when stereo recording was still in its infancy. But damn, now we're talking revelation. Every note on this thing is beautifully vivid, and it doesn't hurt that the music (the New Orleans standard "St. James Infirmary") is stellar. My memories of a lesser Louis Armstrong doing "Hello Dolly" or the sentimental "What a Wonderful World" (a song I'd rank down there with "She's Leaving Home") are melting away by the minute. And here I'm learning one of the secrets: that good stereo sound is a psychedelic experience. I'm not just seeing Satchmo's horn, I'm seeing the shape of the notes and the color of the sound. When he sings, I'm looking deep down into his throat while the drums and bass push me from behind. So now I understand why a lot of record collectors don't do drugs--when they crank that stereo up, they're already doing one. Every vinyl junkie has a moment like this, when the sound hits you between the eyes and you're hooked for life. Pat got the rush when "Be My Baby" by the Ronettes was blaring from a car radio. Producer Phil Spector made that record to be overwhelming--with its massive drums and heavenly choir--and in Pat's case (and that of the Beach Boys's Brian Wilson, who also loved the record) it did the trick. As for Monoman, he gets reinitiated every time he discovers a new medium. Lately hisdrug of ...</p><h2>Patches of Stars: 17 Quilt Patterns and a Gallery of Inspiring Antique Quilts</h2><p><p>The third book in Edyta Sitar's best-selling "Patches" series celebrates a quintessential quiltmaking motif: the star.

Rivera has stumbled way out of his depth. Those letters contain a secret that someone cannot allow to be made public. A lot happened between Cuba and the United States in those years. Many men died. A few more will hardly be noticed.</p><p><b>Randy Wayne White</b> is the author of twenty-two Doc Ford books, including the latest, <i>Deep Blue</i>. He has also had four collections of his columns for <i>Outside</i> magazine and elsewhere published&#x2014;and the new Hannah Smith series has debuted with <i>Gone</i>, <i>Deceived</i>, and <i>Haunted</i>. In 2002, a one-hour documentary film called <i>The Gift of the Game</i>, about White&#x2019;s trip to Cuba to find the remnants of the Little League teams founded by Ernest Hemingway in the days before Castro, won the Best of the Fest Award from the 2002 Woods Hole Film Festival, then was bought by PBS and broadcast station by station in the spring and summer of 2003. A veteran fishing guide who at one time had his own local PBS show, he lives in an old house on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.1<br>At sunrise in November, Marion D. Ford, wearing shorts<br>and jungle boots, jogged the tide line where Sanibel Island<br>crescents north, and finally said, &#x201c;Screw it,&#x201d; tired of wind<br>and pelting sand. To his right were colorful cottages&#x2014;red, yellow,<br>green&#x2014;The Castaways, a popular resort during season, but this was<br>Tuesday and a slow time of year. He went to the outdoor shower,<br>thinking he&#x2019;d hide his boots and swim through the breakers. He<br>was ten pounds overweight and sick of his own excuses.<br><br>A porch door opened: a woman backlit by clouds of cinnamon,<br>the sun up but not hot enough to burn through. &#x201c;Want some coffee?&#x201d;<br>She cupped her hands to be heard. &#x201c;Your dog&#x2019;s welcome, if he&#x2019;s sociable.&#x201d;<br><br>No idea who the woman was. Wearing a sweatshirt, with an<br>articulate, strong voice that suggested Midwestern genetics: a descendant<br>of dairymaids good at sports and baking pies. Late thirties, a<br>rental compact in the drive, only one pair of sandals outside the door:<br>a woman on a budget vacationing alone.<br><br>Ford said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m punishing myself.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman replied, &#x201c;You, too?&#x201d; and walked toward him, started<br>to speak but stopped, got up on her toes, focusing on something<br>out there in the waves. &#x201c;What in the world . . . is that someone drowning?&#x201d;<br><br>Beyond the sandbar, Ford saw what might have been a barrel<br>but one thrashing appendage told him was not. He removed his<br>glasses. &#x201c;A loggerhead, I think. This isn&#x2019;t mating season, so it must<br>be hurt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Logger-what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A sea turtle.&#x201d; Ford handed her his glasses, jogged to the breakers,<br>and duck-dived, still wearing his damn boots. The dog, which was a<br>retriever but not a Lab or golden, swam after him. That was a mistake, too.<br><br>The turtle, barnacles on its back, was tangled in fishing line, and,<br>yes, drowning. Ford had to alternately battle his dog, then the turtle,<br>which hissed and struck like a snake while he maneuvered the thing<br>through waves into the shallows. The woman was impressed. &#x201c;You<br>seem to know what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On rare occasions. Do you have a knife?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to . . . ?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman galloped to the cottage, her sweatshirt bouncing in<br>counter-synch, legs not long but solid. Nice. She watched Ford cut the<br>turtle free, inspect it for cuts, then nurse the animal back through the<br>surf, where he side-stroked alongside for a while.<br>&nbsp;<br>The woman was waiting with a towel, coffee in a mug, and water for the dog.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not come inside and dry off? Or a hot shower, if you like,<br>but you&#x2019;ll have to forgive the mess.&#x201d; The look the woman gave him<br>was unmistakable&#x2014;not that Ford often got that look from women<br>he didn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;Three mornings straight I&#x2019;ve watched you run past<br>here,&#x201d;&#x2014;an awkward smile&#x2014;&#x201c;so I finally worked up the nerve. Is<br>it always this windy in November?&#x201d;<br><br>Ford cleaned his glasses with the towel. &#x201c;Nerve?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Old-fashioned, I guess. You know, speaking to strange men and<br>all that.&#x201d; Another look, eyes aware, before she added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here all alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford tested several excuses before he followed the woman inside.<br>He was thinking, <i>Why do the lonely ones choose islands?</i><br><br>That night in Fort Myers. off Daniels Road, he was at Hammond<br>Stadium, where the Minnesota Twins train, one of the practice<br>fields, listening to his friend Tomlinson ramble on about something,<br>but not really listening.<br><br>&#x201c;Which is why,&#x201d; his friend concluded, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t even watch a game<br>on TV without wearing the ol&#x2019; codpiece.&#x201d;<br><br>Mentioning fish got Ford&#x2019;s attention. &#x201c;You caught a cod? They<br>don&#x2019;t migrate this far south.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, man&#x2014;<i>my cup</i>. Until a woman finds an expiration date on<br>my dick, I simply will not risk the Hat Trick Twins.&#x201d; Tomlinson<br>rapped three bell tones from between his legs to illustrate, which<br>proved nothing, because they were sitting in a dugout, under lights,&nbsp;<br>wearing baseball uniforms, not in a bar watching TV. On the field<br>was a Senior League team from Orlando, a left-hander warming<br>up while the umpires kibitzed, game time stalled for no apparent<br>reason.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tomlinson muttered, &#x201c;Geezus, what&#x2019;s the holdup?&#x201d; He grabbed<br>the fence, yelled, &#x201c;Hey, blue&#x2014;while we&#x2019;re still young, okay?&#x201d; before<br>returning to Ford. &#x201c;You seem distracted, ol&#x2019; buddy. Romantic problems<br>or is it something unusual?&#x201d;<br><br>Ford replied, &#x201c;This morning I found a turtle tangled in fishing<br>line&#x2014;one of those crimped wire leaders tourists buy at Walgreens. I<br>assumed it was a loggerhead because they&#x2019;re so common. Now I don&#x2019;t<br>think so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was it dead? Goddamn pharmaceutical companies. They&#x2019;d sell<br>Pop-Tarts to diabetics if it bumped their numbers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The turtle was only about fifty pounds but already had barnacles<br>growing. See what I&#x2019;m getting at? Even a young loggerhead or<br>hawksbill would be closer to a hundred. Or maybe I&#x2019;m wrong about<br>that, too. I had him in my hands but didn&#x2019;t bother to notice details.<br>Embarrassing, how little I know about sea turtles. Wouldn&#x2019;t you expect<br>a biologist to notice what the hell species it was?&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson knew the pitcher from Orlando or would not have<br>yelled, &#x201c;Joe . . . Hey, Joey&#x2014;put some color in that rainbow. Slow-pitch<br>is for commies, dude.&#x201d; This ultra-left-wing Zen Buddhist priest (he&#x2019;d<br>been ordained in Japan) and dope-smoking boat bum was a different<br>person when he exited reality and entered a baseball field.<br><br>Joey flipped Tomlinson the bird.<br><br>Ford mused, &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m thinking it might have been a Kemp&#x2019;s<br>Ridley turtle, or even a Pacific Ridley. Two of the rarest in the<br>world&#x2014;the thing snapped at me like a dog, which is typical according<br>to the literature. And its shell was too round. Had it right there in<br>my hands; swam with it and still didn&#x2019;t dawn on me. If that&#x2019;s not a<br>metaphor for something, I don&#x2019;t know what the hell is.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford hunched forward and retied his spikes, Tomlinson saying, &#x201c;I<br>should&#x2019;ve never gotten rid of my old Kangaroos. These new Mizunos<br>pinch my toe rings. I hate that.&#x201d; Then hollered through the screen,<br>&#x201c;Oh great, now I&#x2019;ve got to piss <i>again</i>. Guys . . . I have a Masonic meeting<br>tomorrow. Any chance we&#x2019;ll be done?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Ford sat up. &#x201c;Know what&#x2019;s odd? Two days ago, I was reading<br>about sightings of Pacific Ridleys in the Cuba Straits. I just remembered.<br>Olive Ridleys, actually, but they&#x2019;re the same thing. A few nests<br>documented along this coast, too. Even north of Sarasota.&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson reverted to his role as Zen master. &#x201c;Nothing accidental<br>about coincidence, Doc. Hey&#x2014;just listen, for once. You&#x2019;re being<br>nudged toward something. Or away. Or into a new avenue of study.<br>Karma seldom grabs a rational man by the balls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say it was a coincidence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not the Cuba part.&#x201d; Ford checked the bleachers&#x2014;only a couple<br>of wives in attendance&#x2014;then found the main field, where stadium<br>lights created a silver dome. Minnesota&#x2019;s minor league team, the Miracle,<br>was playing St. Pete, a few hundred fans in attendance. He said,<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see when he gets here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If he shows up,&#x201d; Ford said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll understand. A friend from&nbsp;<br>Central America. He was drunk when he called, which might explain<br>why he&#x2019;s late. Or might not.&#x201d;<br><br>That made perfect sense to Tomlinson. He nodded, fingering a<br>scar on his temple hidden by scraggly hair&#x2014;a figure eight which he<br>insisted was an infinity symbol.<br><br>&#x201c;Saving that Ridley is the coincidence. If it was a Ridley. The data<br>goes back to 1953&#x2014;one was caught in nets off Pinar del R�o on<br>Cuba&#x2019;s western coast. A few years back, a Ridley was photographed<br>laying eggs near Sarasota. They&#x2019;re not supposed to be in the Gulf or<br>Caribbean, but sea turtles are like underwater birds. They travel anywhere<br>they want; flawless navigation systems, which suggests a magnetic<br>sensitivity that&#x2019;s still not understood. It crossed my mind I&#x2019;ve<br>never actually seen a Ridley. Not confirmed anyway, which is why<br>I&#x2019;m pissed at myself about this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson&#x2019;s attention focused. &#x201c;<i>Really</i>? You sure that&#x2019;s the only<br>reason?&#x201d; He said it as if envisioning a woman who was lonely and<br>alone in her vacation cottage. Then added, &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re not thinking<br>about going back to Cuba. That&#x2019;s risking jail, man; a firing squad,<br>from what I remember. Or has something changed?&#x201d;<br><br>Ford shrugged, adjusted his protective gear, and buckled his pants.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask Victor to catch the first few innings. He might have gone to<br>the wrong field.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vic? No . . . he went to his car to get eye black. What about Cuba?<br>You know I&#x2019;m right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not him. The guy I was talking about.&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson said to Ford, whose spikes clicked as he walked away,<br>&#x201c;Not if I&#x2019;m called in to pitch, you&#x2019;re not leaving. Hey . . . <i>Whoa</i>! Do&nbsp;<br>you have a death wish or get dumped again? Dude . . . I can talk you<br>through this.&#x201d;<br><i><br>There is a fine line between getting dumped and a relationship<br>ended by the unanimous vote of one.</i><br><br>Ford thought about that as he walked past the spring training<br>clubhouse, across the parking lot to the stadium, into a tunnel of noise<br>and odors: popcorn, beer, and grilled brats. Cuba was also on his<br>mind. What Tomlinson said would&#x2019;ve been true a few years ago but<br>might be okay now with the right cover story&#x2014;or a companion with<br>the right political ties.<br><br>The man he was searching for had those ties.<br><br>Ford spotted him in the outfield cheap seats, alone above the bull<br>pen. The nearest cluster of fans was three sections closer to third base.<br>The man had been watching relief pitchers warm up, not the game,<br>but was now arguing with two security cops.<br><br>No doubt who it was, even from a distance. The man&#x2019;s size and his<br>choice of seats would have been enough.<br><br>Baseball spikes are tricky on aluminum. It took Ford awhile to get<br>to left field and intervene on behalf of the man who was an old<br>enemy and sometimes a friend&#x2014;General Juan Sim�n Rivera, recently<br>arrived from Central America via Havana.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell them,&#x201d; Rivera said in English when he spotted Ford. &#x201c;Tell<br>them who I am. Perhaps they will understand that diplomatic immunity<br>includes baseball and cigars.&#x201d;<br>He&#x2019;d been smoking a Cohiba, that was the problem.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ford replied in Spanish. &#x201c;You want me to blow your cover, General?&#x201d;<br>This was safe to ask in front of two Anglo sheriffs deputies<br>who resembled farmhands.<br><br>Rivera, the former dictator of Masagua, a tiny country that exported<br>bananas and revolution, got control of himself. Decided,<br>&#x201c;Hmm. A man of my intellect is seldom a donkey&#x2019;s ass, but good<br>point. Yes . . . better to indulge these fascists&#x2014;for now.&#x201d; Spoke loudly<br>in slang Spanish, then waited with regal impatience while Ford pacified the cops.<br><br>When they were gone, Ford endured a bear hug; they exchanged<br>pleasantries&#x2014;who was married, how many wives, how many kids.<br>Rivera, finally getting to it, said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you recognized me.<br>I&#x2019;ve come incognito for a reason.&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of signature khakis and boots, he wore a yellow Hawaiian<br>shirt, a Disney visor, and flip-flops. Not enough to disguise a husky<br>Latino with a gray-splotched beard and wild Russian hair, but Ford<br>played along.<br><br>&#x201c;A European tourist, General, that&#x2019;s what I thought at first. Very<br>clever.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, it took me awhile.&#x201d;<br><br>Rivera expected that. It was a game they played, informal formality,<br>but each man knew the truth about the other. He said, &#x201c;Sometimes<br>a wolf must blend with the sheep. Yet, not clever enough to fool<br>you, my old catcher friend.&#x201d; He noticed Ford&#x2019;s uniform &#x201c;Why are you<br>not on the field? I might even agree to pitch a few innings . . . <i>if</i> you<br>have a large uniform. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be clean, but it cannot be an<br>even number. I&#x2019;m partial to the numbers three, nine, and thirtyseven.&#x201d;<br>With his hands, he gestured:&nbsp;<i>I think you understand</i>.<br><br>Santer�a, a mix of Catholicism and voodoo, was big on numerology,<br>especially when it came to baseball. Rivera was devoted to the<br>game. In Central America, he had built his own field in the rainforest<br>and drafted soldiers based on their batting averages. He fancied<br>himself a great pitcher whose politics had ruined his shot at the major leagues.<br><br>Ford replied, &#x201c;General, my teammates would be honored. But,<br>first . . . why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Always the same with you, Marion. Rush, rush, rush. Only bachelorhood<br>has spared you ulcers, I think.&#x201d; Rivera nodded to the bull<br>pen, where a pitcher who looked sixteen but was almost seven feet<br>tall, sat with his hat askew. &#x201c;That is Ruben. He&#x2019;s one of my prot�g�s.<br>The Twins have offered him a tryout, but a mere formality. Ruben&#x2019;s<br>fastball rivals my own, yet he is a southpaw, as you can tell from his<br>sombrero.&#x201d;<br><br>A joke. <i>Gorro</i> was Spanish for &#x201c;cap.&#x201d; The general was in a pawky mood.<br><br>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t be from Masagua. I never saw anyone from Masagua<br>much over six feet&#x2014;except for you. Are you his agent?&#x201d;<br>Rivera touched an index finger to his lips. &#x201c;Unfortunately, the<br>situation requires that Ruben pretends he doesn&#x2019;t know me. I can&#x2019;t<br>explain right now.&#x201d;<br>Ford could guess where this was going but waited.<br>&#x201c;I have an interesting proposition, Marion.&#x201d;<br>Ford said, &#x201c;In Cuba.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I told you as much on the phone. A nice chunk of silver in U.S.<br>dollars if you agree.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford sensed trouble but also escape: turtles, isolated beaches, a<br>land without cell phones&#x2014;if he wasn&#x2019;t arrested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll listen, but I don&#x2019;t<br>do that sort of work anymore. Not if it&#x2019;s dangerous. Or political<br>work&#x2014;count me out if politics are involved.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t ruled out<br>human trafficking in deference to his own curiosity.<br><br>&#x201c;Politics?&#x201d; Rivera said. &#x201c;I spit on the word. I piss on their speeches.<br>To hell with their silly games. I am a freedom fighter&#x2014;always&#x2014;but<br>have learned there are benefits to this free enterprise system of yours.<br>A man is allowed to change, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only the small-minded hate change, General.&#x201d;<br><br>In clumsy English, Rivera replied, &#x201c;You can say that twice. We<br>will feast ourselves several days in Cuba. A week at most, every expenses<br>paid. But, first&#x201d;&#x2014;he hesitated while shifting to Spanish&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I have a little problem here that must be dealt with.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In Florida?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let us hope so.&#x201d; Rivera leaned closer to speak over the noise of<br>the PA system. &#x201c;I have lost a baseball player. Temporarily, I&#x2019;m sure,<br>but it would be unwise to contact your police.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How long has he been missing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not &#x2018;missing&#x2019;; &#x2018;wandered off.&#x2019; Since this morning, when I visited<br>his motel&#x2014;a place not far from here, with a large red sign. Without<br>shoes or money, the lunatic could not have gone far.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s crazy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well . . . no more than most, but he&#x2019;s not as smart as normal men.<br>And honest, very honest, which makes him unpredictable.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford had spent much of his life on the water and in baseball dug-<br>outs, which is why he asked, &#x201c;Were his glove and bat missing? He<br>could have worn spikes instead of shoes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think...</p><h2>The Utah UFO Display: A Scientist&#39;s Report</h2><p>Do UFOs really exist?

This trail is part of the Schuylkill River Trail (also see page 133), a proposed 130-mile-long trail along the Schuylkill River. </p><p>The trail originally stopped short in Center City because the area between the railroad tracks and the river was too narrow for a trail. So the City of Philadelphia and the Schuylkill River Development Corporation partnered to build a 2,000-foot-long boardwalk that takes you out over the river. The views are amazing, and you actually feel like you are on top of the river. </p><p>Parking is at Lloyd Hall, at the beginning of Boathouse Row, and the trail goes right along the parking area toward the river. As the trail weaves its way toward the river, you&#x2019;ll pass behind the Philadelphia Museum of Art and in front of the Fairmount Waterworks. When you see Fairmount Waterworks, you&#x2019;ll cross the road and pick up the trail on your left. </p><p>This is a heavily trafficked trail, so it&#x2019;s best to stay to the right at all times and keep any dogs on a short leash. </p><p>Continue following the path as it winds its way along the river. You&#x2019;ll eventually cross under Spring Garden Street and West River Drive/Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The rest of the trail runs beside the scenic Schuylkill River. </p><p>Benches offer a place to stop and relax if you would like to do so. The trail also follows active train tracks, so you might see a train during your hike. When you come to a fork in the path just after you go under the Market Street Bridge, take the right path. Both paths end up in the same place, but the section to the right seems to have fewer bikes on it and is closer to the river. </p><p>Booths provide information along the way, and you can even find out how to kayak the Schuylkill River. There is a bathroom stop at Walnut Street, and there&#x2019;s also a water fountain if you need a water break. </p><p>When you see the bridge ahead, stay straight on the path. You&#x2019;ll see a ramp off to the left at Locust Street that can take you to the Schuylkill River Park and the Schuylkill River Park Dog Run if you have a four-legged friend with you. But, for the purpose of this hike, continue on the boardwalk. </p><p>When you see the South Street Bridge ahead, you&#x2019;ll see part of the trail goes off to the left. That will take you up to the South Street Bridge. To continue on the trail, stay straight and go under the bridge. </p><p>The trail ends just under the South Street Bridge, so you can turn around and head back the way you came. You&#x2019;ll follow the same path you took to get back to the parking area at Lloyd Hall, enjoying the sights along the way. Just before you get to the Fairmount Waterworks, there&#x2019;s a water fountain for humans, with a low fountain for dogs if your pet needs a water break. </p><p><b>NEARBY ACTIVITIES</b> </p><p>The Philadelphia Museum of Art is a world-renowned art museum and is right next to the trail. Hours and admission vary. Visit philamuseum.org for details. </p><p><b>GPS Trailhead Coordinates:</b> </p><p>N39�58.127' W75�11.077' </p><p><b>DIRECTIONS</b> From Center City, take I-76 W to Exit 342 (Girard Ave./Philadelphia Zoo). Turn right onto W. Girard Ave., and after 0.2 mile, turn right onto Sedgley Dr. After 0.6 mile, Sedgley Dr. crosses Kelly Dr. and becomes Waterworks Dr.; directly to your right is Lloyd Hall.</p></p><h2>The Witness for the Prosecution and Other Stories</h2><p><p><em><strong>Witness for the Prosecution and Other Stories</strong></em><strong> is a collection of eleven tantalizing tales of murder and other criminal pursuits&#x2014;including the classic title story, the basis for the 1957 Oscar-nominated Billy Wilder film starring Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power, and Charles Laughton.</strong></p><p>A murder trial takes a diabolical turn when the wife of the accused takes the stand. . . .

Flamboyant, charismatic and brilliant, he remains almost as notorious for his life - as a political revolutionary, sexual adventurer and traveller - as he does for his literary work. Yet he produced some of the most daring and exuberant poetry of the Romantic age, from 'To Caroline' and 'To Woman' to the satirical English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, his exotic Eastern tales and the colourful narrative of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, the work that made him famous overnight and gave birth to the idea of the brooding Byronic hero.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

He was also a satirist whose poetry and personality captured the imagination of Europe. His major works include Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812-18) and Don Juan (1819-24).

Euchrid Eucrow, despised ungainly son of a trapper father and "slobstress" mother, grows up mute but divinely inspired during the 1940s and '50s in fundamentalist Ukulore, a rural swamp peopled with cartoon-like sinners, tricksters, retardates and imbibers of moonshine. Euchrid--self-styled Monarch of Doghead--heeds a winsome guardian angel, along with talking beasts (the title evokes Balaam's ass), and is obsessed with human cruelty and carnality. The foundling Beth, becoming revered as a child-saint, believes Euchrid is divine; Euchrid slips into her room, and is brutally hunted down by Beth's avengers. The plot, rife with gory atrocities, is relayed through clotted, gutsy prose which ranges from poetic to rabid, and is interspersed throughout with graphs, lists, genealogies and scraps of Scripture. Although Cave's manic effort will not lure traditionalists, it may snare the more adventurous. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ascetic Lives of Mothers: A Prayer Book for Orthodox Moms</h2><p>Annalisa Boyd knows motherhood its challenges, its joys, and its potential for spiritual growth.

As their symbols were a red rose for Lancaster and a white rose for York, the conflict became known as the Wars of the Roses.<br> <br>During this time, the house of York came to dominate England. At its heart were three charismatic brothers&#x2014;King Edward IV, and his two younger siblings George and Richard&#x2014;who became the figureheads of a spectacular ruling dynasty. Together, they looked invincible.<br> <br>But with Edward&#x2019;s ascendancy the brothers began to turn on one another, unleashing a catastrophic chain of rebellion, vendetta, fratricide, usurpation, and regicide. The brutal end came at Bosworth Field in 1485, with the death of the youngest, then Richard III, at the hands of a new usurper, Henry Tudor, later Henry VII, progenitor of the Tudor line of monarchs.<br> <br>Fascinating, dramatic, and filled with vivid historical detail, <i>The Brothers York</i> is a brilliant account of a conflict that fractured England for a generation. Riven by internal rivalries, jealousy, and infighting, the three York brothers failed to sustain their power and instead self-destructed.

Others requested me to prepare a collection of matter for the sermons of the missions and of the spiritual exercises. Not to multiply books, labor, and expense, I resolved to compose the work in the present form, with the hope that it might answer both purposes. To render it useful as a book of meditations for seculars, I have divided the considerations into three points. Each point will serve for one meditation, and therefore I have annexed to each point affections and prayers. I entreat my readers not to grow weary, if, in those prayers, they always find petitions for the grace of perseverance and of divine love. For us, these are the two graces most necessary for the attainment of eternal salvation. The grace of divine love is, according to St. Francis de Sales, the grace which contains in itself all graces: because the virtue of charity toward God brings with it all other virtues. Now all good things come to me together with her (Wisd. VII, II) He who loves God is humble, chaste, obedient, and mortified; in a word, he possesses all virtues. &#34; Love,&#34; says St. Augustine, &#34; and do what you wish&#34; (Ama, et fac quod vis). They who love God labor to avoid whatever is offensive to him, and seek to please him in all things. The grace of perseverance is that grace by which we obtain the eternal crown. St. Bernard says that Paradise is promised to those who begin a good life, but is only given to those who persevere. &#34; To beginners a reward is promised, but to him who perseveres it is given;.&#34; (De modo bene vivere, s. 6) But this gift of perseverance is, as the Fathers teach, given only to those who ask it. Hence St. Thomas asserts that to enter heaven continual prayer is necessary. And our Redeemer said: We ought always to pray, and not to faint. (Luke XIII, 1) It is because they do not pray for the gift of perseverance that so many miserable sinners, after having obtained pardon, lose again the grace of God. Their sins are forgiven; but because they afterward neglect to ask of God the grace of perseverance, particularly in the time of temptations, they relapse into sin. And although the grace of final perseverance is altogether gratuitous, and cannot be merited by good works; still Suarez teaches that it can be infallibly obtained by prayer: and according to St. Augustine, it may be merited by humble supplication.(De Dono persev. C. 6) This necessity of prayer I have demonstrated at length in another little work, entitled The Great Means of Prayer. This book, though small, has cost me a great deal of labor. I consider it to be of extreme utility to all sorts of persons; and I unhesitatingly assert that, among all spiritual treatises, there is none, and there can be none, more necessary than that which treats on prayer as a means of obtaining eternal salvation. To render these considerations useful to preachers who have but few books or little time for reading, I have furnished these considerations with texts of Scripture and passages from the Fathers, which are short, but strong and animated, as they ought to be in sermons. The three points of each consideration will supply matter for one sermon. I have endeavored to collect from many authors the sentiments which appeared to me best suited to move the will, and have inserted several of them expressed briefly, that the reader may select and extend at pleasure those that please him most. May all tend to the glory of God! I pray my reader to recommend me to Jesus Christ, whether I am living or dead (Now that St. Alphonsus Liguori is a canonized Saint we ask for his intercession); and I promise to do the same for all those who perform this act of charity toward me. Live Jesus, our love, and Mary, our hope! This work is excerpted from a larger work of Saint Alphonsus with the same name.</p><p></p><h2>The Yellow Rose Beauty Shop</h2><p><p>Stella&#x2019;s mama never should&#x2019;ve put Stella on the church prayer list.

Scott&#x2019;s book deserves not just to be read, but to be kept on your shelf, because as with David Halberstam&#x2019;s <i>The Best and Brightest</i> or Neil Sheehan&#x2019;s <i>A Bright Shining Lie</i>, I expect Horton&#x2019;s book to not just explain and interpret a current American war, but to explain and interpret the all too predictable future American wars, and the unavoidable waste and suffering that will accompany them.&#x201d; &#x2014; Capt. Matthew Hoh, USMC (ret.), former senior State Department official, Zabul Province, Afghanistan, Senior Fellow at the Center for International Policy<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Fool&#x2019;s Errand</i> is a hidden history of America&#x2019;s forgotten war, laid bare in damning detail. Scott Horton masterfully retells the story of America&#x2019;s failed intervention, exposes how Obama&#x2019;s troop surge did not bring Afghanistan any closer to peace, and warns that the conflict could go on in perpetuity &#x2014; unless America ends the war. As Trump threatens to send more troops to Afghanistan, Horton shows why the answer to a brutal civil war is not more war, which makes Fool&#x2019;s Errand a scintillating and sorely needed chronicle of the longest war in American history.&#x201d; &#x2014; Anand Gopal, journalist and author of <i>No Good Men Among the Living: America, the Taliban, and the War Through Afghan Eyes</i><br><br>&#x201c;Scott Horton&#x2019;s new book <i>Fool&#x2019;s Errand: Time to End the War in Afghanistan</i> has a title that tells you where it is going, but to think that is all it is about would be to sell short a comprehensive work that takes the reader on a long journey starting in the 1980s. Indeed, if there were a university course on what went wrong with Afghanistan, starting with Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s Holy Warriors and continuing with George W. Bush&#x2019;s ouster of the Taliban leading to 15 years of feckless nation building, this book could well serve as the textbook. Horton provides insights into key decision-making along the way as he meticulously documents the dreadful series of misadventures that have brought us to the latest surge, which will fail just like all the others.

She lives in Toledo, Ohio, with her husband, David Powers, with whom she often collaborates.A robin&#x2019;s nest is fabricated with a little help from a squirrel and other familiar animals. Each creature contributes a key ingredient to make a sturdy abode for the bird in which to lay her eggs. When the eggs hatch they quickly grow into nestlings, &#x201c;tuffed and pink,&#x201d; rapidly turning into fledglings ready to spread their wings. The proud mama watches as her young ones fly for the first time. Richly hued illustrations are mixed media done using a printing technique and collage. They are expressive, textured, and show various perspectives. Vertically oriented pages support the illustrations, calling to mind the height of a tree, and are accompanied by a cumulative, alliterative, and rhyming text done in the familiar cadence of &#x201c;The House That Jack Built.&#x201d; VERDICT A handsome choice to welcome spring and new life that will read aloud well with a group or in an intimate setting. -- School Library Journal, <i>January 2018</i><br><br>Like a fresh spring breeze, Fleming&#x2019;s cumulative tale celebrates a favorite symbol of the season, a robin&#x2019;s nest. Beginning with a squirrel &#x201c;who trimmed the twigs, not too big,/ that anchor the nest that Robin built,&#x201d; Fleming (<i>5 Little Ducks</i>) introduces several animals that provide the materials the bird needs to craft the resting spot for her &#x201c;eggs, brittle and blue.&#x201d; The verse is saturated with alliteration and internal rhymes (&#x201c;This is the&nbsp;<i>mouse</i>/ who gathered the weeds, dotted with seeds,/ that bind the mud, soft not soupy,/ that plasters the straw, rough and tough...&#x201d;), and the collage illustrations gain bold, mottled textures from the varied printmaking techniques Fleming used to treat the paper before assembling them. When the nestlings, &#x201c;tufted and pink,&#x201d; finally arrive, a foldout spread reveals all of the work that went into the nest; small vignettes show Robin combining twigs, string, straw, mud, and more to put it together. Fleming&#x2019;s nature scenes pulse with electric shades of green, highlighting the hive of activity that precedes the arrival of a newborn (or three).&nbsp; -- Publishers Weekly, <i>January 22, 2018</i><br><br>A mother robin builds a nest with a little help from nearby creatures. It starts with the squirrel, "who trimmed the twigs, not too big, / that anchor the nest that Robin built." Then the dog brings string, the horse shares straw, the pig mixes mud, and so on. It's a riff on the classic rhyme "This Is the House That Jack Built," but Fleming keeps the text fresh with additional rhyming adjectives. Whether "not too big," "long and strong," or "soft not soupy," each new item Robin receives has its own specifications. Thus, the cumulative story expertly reinforces narrative comprehension while also building vocabulary. Fleming combines her signature printmaking techniques with collage to make beautifully textured illustrations filled with natural tones and repeated patterns. The creatures are mostly to scale, some fitting within the book and some extending beyond its pages. Though the animals change with each page turn, readers will enjoy spotting the tiny ladybugs hidden in each illustration. The narrow portrait trim size expands with a final gatefold that flips the structure of the verse to conclude with the new, "rumpled and ruffled" fledglings flying away&#x2014;a satisfying conclusion. An avian revision of a classic rhyme that soars. (Picture book. 3-7)&nbsp; -- Kirkus, <i>2/15/18</i><br><br>A celebration of bits and pieces, of process, and of creation, this picture book describes how a robin builds a nest, shown through collage art that mirrors the bird&#x2019;s methods and cumulative verse that pays homage to &#x201c;The House That Jack Built.&#x201d; &#x201c;This is the squirrel who trimmed the twigs, not too big, that anchor the nest that Robin built.&#x201d; The dog supplies string, the horse provides straw, the pig mixes mud, the mouse gathers weeds and seeds, the rabbit picks grass; from this sequence (i.e., &#x201c;with a little help from her friends&#x201d;), the robin constructs a perfect nest to house three eggs, which hatch into three nestlings. On the next spread a gatefold opens to carry readers back through the litany of steps the robin took to build her nest. The story closes as the baby birds, deftly rendered with cut paper and fluff, bravely leave the nest: &#x201c;...now young fledglings, rumpled and ruffled, and ready to fly / Good- / bye!&#x201d; Fleming&#x2019;s introduction to nest-building and the life cycle of a robin takes a gratifyingly holistic view of the process. The jaunty rhythm of the text and the large, vibrant illustrations full of detail, along with a supporting minor cast of insects and other creatures, make for a lively story to share individually or with groups. -- The Horn Book *STARRED REVIEW, <i>March/April</i></p><h2>Sing to the Lord: Music in Divine Worship (Pastoral Liturgy)</h2><p>Sing to the Lord provides basic guidelines for understanding the role and ministry of music in the liturgy.

Their intersection is rather insignificant, a fact mirrored in the racial segregation that has always characterized Atlantan society. Pomerantz has traced the history of the city, and the development of race relations from the city&#39;s founding to the present day, through the experiences of two emblematic and influential families: that of Ivan Allen Jr., a white mayor in the 60&#39;s; and that of Maynard H. Jackson, the city&#39;s first black mayor. The result is a vividly humanized and objective history.<b>Gary M.

From the early migration of citrus from the foothills of the Himalayas to Italy's shores to the persistent role of unique crops such as bergamot (and its place in the perfume and cosmetics industries) and the vital role played by Calabria's unique Diamante citrons in the Jewish celebration of Sukkoth, author Helena Attlee brings the fascinating history and its gustatory delights to life.</p><p>Whether the Battle of Oranges in Ivrea, the gardens of Tuscany, or the story of the Mafia and Sicily's citrus groves, Attlee transports readers on a journey unlike any other.</p></p><p>Helena Attlee is the author of many gardening books and has contributed articles to numerous magazines. She leads garden tours around the world.Thrillingly sensual, and zesty in every sense, Helena Attlee is the best of companions as she leads us through sundrenched citrus groves and in and out of history. A book full of surprises, with many curiosities, stories and recipes on the way -- Deborah Moggach, author of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Inspired and inspiring, in prose as sharp as the fruit it celebrates -- David Wheeler, editor of Hortus This is the first among my books of the year. Every page of Attlee&#39;s subtle fusion of history and horticulture made me feel that it&#39;s time to pack the bags again for Italy -- Jonathan Keates * Literary Review * 4 stars. Attlee, who knows and loves Italy and the Italians, takes the reader through the country&#39;s scented gardens with her sharp descriptions, pertinent stories and quotes and intriguing recipes. I was there with her -- Anna del Conte * Sunday Telegraph * Fascinating . . . A distinguished garden writer, Attlee fell under the spell of citrus over ten years ago and the book, like the eleventh labour of Hercules to steal the golden fruit of the Hesperides, is the result. She writes with great lucidity, charm and gentle humour, and wears her considerable learning lightly . . . Helena Attlee&#39;s elegant, absorbing prose and sure-footed ability to combine the academic with the anecdotal, make The Land Where Lemons Grow a welcome addition to the library of citrologists and Italophiles alike * The Times Literary Supplement * A paradise of citrus is how I always think of Italy too: a place where ice-cold limoncello is sipped from tiny glasses on piazzas, and everything from ricotta cake to osso bucco is enlivened with zest. What a joy, therefore, to read Helena Attlee&#39;s The Land Where Lemons Grow, which tells the story of Italy through its citrus fruit -- Bee Wilson * Telegraph * Truly fascinating . . . For many years, Attlee has been collecting evidence for a story of citrus trees in Italy. The result, The Land Where Lemons Grow, is remarkable, excellently produced and essential for all lovers of Italy, their summer libraries and out-of-season itineraries . . . Attlee&#39;s book is unmissable for anyone intrigued by the relation between humans&#39; travel, greed and ingenuity and the spread of the plants that we eat, smell and drink -- Robin Lane Fox * Financial Times * &#39;It would be a treat to find The Land Where Lemons Grow under the tree&#39; -- Carolyn Hart * Telegraph, Books of the Year * &#39;It turned out to be the book I pressed on friends more than any other this year. If they were bemused, I hope they remained to be charmed. I read it randomly a few pages at a time until there were no pages I hadn&#39;t read twice.

Facts tend to be appropriately simple for the grade and reading levels. The large type is positioned on a white background and does not interfere with the full-color drawings. The illustrations lack pizzazz yet fit in well with the text. Several simple maps clue readers in to where the story is taking place.

The perpetually insouciant glaze of his characters belie the sharp verbal and visual wit of Furie, who delivers a stoner classic for the Tumblr generation. In fact, Furie&#x2019;s wildly popular teenage weirdoes became an overnight internet sensation when Pepe the Frog was widely adopted by users of 4chan and remixed ad infinitum from there (including uses by pop stars like Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry), giving Boy&#x2019;s Club built-in recognition with many. A spiritual cousin to Simon Hanselmann&#x2019;s Megahex and Jo�n Cornella&#x2019;s Mox Nox, Boy&#x2019;s Club&#x2019;s sense of humor will especially resonate with fans of stoner comedies and black humor.</p><p>Matt Furie, born in 1979 in Columbus, Ohio, is best known for the Rare Pepe meme of 4chan and Tumblr.

The first section, &#x201c;Folly,&#x201d; tells the story of Alice, a young American editor, and her relationship with the famous and much older writer Ezra Blazer. A tender and exquisite account of an unexpected romance that takes place in New York during the early years of the Iraq War, &#x201c;Folly&#x201d; also suggests an aspiring novelist&#x2019;s coming-of-age. By contrast, &#x201c;Madness&#x201d; is narrated by Amar, an Iraqi-American man who, on his way to visit his brother in Kurdistan, is detained by immigration officers and spends the last weekend of 2008 in a holding room in Heathrow.

Two joggers in a row gave them a second glance as they passed. Alice knew who he was&#x2014;she&#x2019;d known the moment he sat down, turning her cheeks watermelon pink&#x2014;but in her astonishment she could only continue staring, like a studious little garden gnome, at the impassable pages that lay open in her lap. They might as well have been made of concrete.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; said the man, rising. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Alice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who likes old stuff.

It&#x2019;s Mister Softee. Where are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Eighty-Fifth and Broadway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, right around the corner. We could string up a couple of tin cans.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice pictured a string, bowing like a giant jump rope over Amsterdam, trembling between them whenever they spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, Miss Alice. What should we do? Would you like to come here, and talk a while? Or should we take a walk together another day?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll come here. Very good. Four thirty?&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice wrote the address down on a piece of junk mail. Then she put a hand over her mouth and waited.<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, let&#x2019;s say five. See you here at five?&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The rain flooded the crosswalks and soaked her feet. The cabs churning a spray up Amsterdam seemed to be traveling much faster than they did when it was dry. While his doorman made room for her by pressing himself into a cruciform position, Alice entered purposefully: long strides, blowing out her cheeks, shaking out her umbrella. The elevator was plated top to bottom with warped brass. Either the floors it climbed were very tall or the elevator was moving very slowly, because she had plenty of time to frown at her infinite funhouse reflections and to worry more than a little about what was going to happen next.<br> <br>When the elevator doors opened, there was a hallway containing six more gray doors. She was about to knock on the first door she came to when another door, on the other side of the elevator, opened a crack and a hand came through, holding a glass.<br> <br>Alice accepted the glass, which was full of water.<br> <br>The door closed.<br> <br>Alice took a sip.<br> <br>The next time the door opened, it seemed to swing wide on its own. Alice hesitated before carrying her water down a short hallway that ended in a bright white room containing, among other things, a draughtsman&#x2019;s desk and an unusually wide bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Show me your purse,&#x201d; he said from behind her.<br> <br>She did.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now open it please. For security reasons.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice set her purse down on the little glass table between them and unlatched it. She took out her wallet: a brown leather men&#x2019;s wallet that was badly worn and torn. A scratch card, purchased for a dollar and worth the same. A ChapStick. A comb. A key ring. A barrette. A mechanical pencil. A few loose coins and, finally, three portable tampons, which she held in her palm like bullets. Fuzz. Grit.<br> <br>&#x201c;No phone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I left it at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>He picked up the wallet, fingering a bit of stitching that had come undone. &#x201c;This is a disgrace, Alice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>He opened the wallet and removed her debit card, her credit card, an expired Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts gift card, her driver&#x2019;s license, her college ID, and twenty-three dollars in bills. Holding up one of the cards: &#x201c;Mary-Alice.&#x201d; Alice wrinkled her nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like the Mary part.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>For a moment, he alternated between looking at her and at the card, as though trying to decide which version of her he preferred. Then he nodded, tapped the cards into alignment, snapped a rubber band from his desk around them and the bills, and dropped the stack back into her purse. The wallet he lobbed into a mesh-wire wastepaper basket already lined with a white cone of discarded typescript. The sight of this seemed to irritate him briefly.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, Mary-Alice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He sat down, gesturing for her to do the same. The seat of his reading chair was black leather and low to the ground, like a Porsche. &#x201c;What else can I do for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice looked around. On the draughtsman&#x2019;s desk a fresh manuscript awaited his attention. Beyond it a pair of sliding glass doors gave onto a small balcony sheltered by the one above it from the rain. Behind her the enormous bed was made up so neatly as to look aloof.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want to go outside?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one throws the other one over. Deal?&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice smiled and, still sitting five feet from him, extended a hand. The writer lowered his eyes to look at it for a long, doubtful moment, as though listed there on her palm were the pros and cons of every handshake he&#x2019;d ever made.<br> <br>&#x201c;On second thought,&#x201d; he said then. &#x201c;Come here.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>His skin was lined and cool.<br> <br>His lips were soft&#x2014;but then his teeth were behind them.<br> <br>At her office, there were no fewer than three National Book Award certificates in his name framed on the lobby wall.<br> <br>The second time, when she knocked, several seconds went by with no answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; Alice said to the door.<br> <br>The door opened a crack and a hand came through, holding a box.<br> <br>Alice took the box.<br> <br>The door closed.<br> <br>Lincoln Stationers, it said on the box, tooled smartly in gold. Inside, under a single sheet of white tissue paper, lay a burgundy wallet with a coin purse and a clutch clasp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my goodness!&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so pretty. Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re velcome,&#x201d; said the door.<br> <br>Again, she was given a glass of water.<br> <br>Again, they did what they did without disturbing the bed.<br> <br>Over her sweater, he put a hand on each breast, as if to silence her.<br> <br>&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s bigger.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Alice, looking down unhappily.<br> <br>&#x201c;No no; it&#x2019;s not an imperfection. There&#x2019;s no such thing as a matching pair.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like snowflakes?&#x201d; suggested Alice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like snowflakes,&#x201d; he agreed.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>From his stomach all the way up to his sternum ran a pink, zipperlike scar. Another scar bisected his leg from groin to ankle. Two more made a faint circumflex above his hip. And that was just the front.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who did this to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Norman Mailer.&#x201d;<br> <br>While she was tugging up her tights, he got up to turn the Yankees game on. &#x201c;Ooh, I love baseball,&#x201d; said Alice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you? Which team?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Red Sox. When I was little, my grandmother used to take me to Fenway every year.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is she still alive, your grandmother?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. Would you like her number? You&#x2019;re about the same age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little early in our relationship for you to be satirizing me, Mary-Alice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; laughed Alice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>They watched as Jason Giambi slugged a three-two pitch into left center.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said the writer, getting up. &#x201c;I almost forgot. I bought you a cookie.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>When they sat looking at each other, across his little glass dining table or she on the bed and he in his chair, she noticed that his head pulsed sideways ever so slightly, as though with the beating of his heart.<br> <br>And, he&#x2019;d had three operations on his spine, which meant there were certain things they could and couldn&#x2019;t do. Shouldn&#x2019;t do.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you to get hurt,&#x201d; said Alice, frowning.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little late for that.&#x201d;<br> <br>They used the bed now. His mattress was made of a special orthopedic material that made her feel as though she were slowly sinking into a giant slab of fudge. Turning her head to the side, she could see, through his double-height windows, the midtown skyline, looking huddled and solemn in the rain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Christ. Oh Jesus Christ. What are you doing? Do you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>Afterward, while she was eating another cookie:<br> <br>&#x201c;Who taught you that, Mary-Alice? Who have you been with?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one,&#x201d; she said, picking a crumb off her lap and eating it. &#x201c;I just imagine what would feel good and I do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you have quite an imagination.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>He called her a mermaid. She didn&#x2019;t know why.<br> <br>Propped beside his keyboard was a tent of white paper on which he had typed:<br> <br>You are an empty vessel for a long time, then something grows that you don&#x2019;t want, something creeps into it that you actually cannot do. The God of Chance creates in us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Endeavours in art require a lot of patience.<br> <br>And below that:<br> <br>An artist, I think, is nothing but a powerful memory that can move itself at will through certain experiences sideways&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>When she opened the refrigerator, his gold medal from the White House, tied to its handle, clanked loudly against the door. Alice went back to the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sweetheart,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wear a condom. Nobody can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what are we going to do about diseases?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I trust you, if you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t trust anyone. What if you become pregnant?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry about that. I&#x2019;d have an abortion.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, while she was washing up in the bathroom, he handed through to her a glass of white wine.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Blackout cookies, they were called, and they came from the Columbus Bakery, which he passed every day on his walk. He tried not to eat them himself. Nor did he drink; alcohol didn&#x2019;t mix with one of the medications he was taking. But for Alice he bought bottles of Sancerre or Pouilly-Fuiss� and, after pouring her what she wanted, put the cork back in the bottle and the bottle on the floor next to the door for her to take home.<br> <br>One evening, a few bites into her cookie, Alice took a sip and made a daintily revolted face.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to seem ungrateful. It&#x2019;s just that, you know, they don&#x2019;t really go.&#x201d;<br> <br>He thought for a moment and then got up and went into the kitchen for a tumbler and a bottle of Knob Creek.<br> <br>&#x201c;Try this.&#x201d;<br> <br>He watched hungrily as she took a bite, then a sip. The bourbon went down like a flame.<br> <br>Alice coughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s heaven,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Other gifts:<br> <br>An extremely sensible, analog, waterproof watch.<br> <br>Allure Chanel eau de parfum.<br> <br>A sheet of thirty-two-cent stamps from the Legends of American Music series, commemorating Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer, Dorothy Fields, and Hoagy Carmichael.<br> <br>A New York Post cover from March 1992 with the headline &#x201c;Weird Sex Act in Bullpen (Late City Final).&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The eighth time, while they were doing one of the things he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to do, he said:<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you. I love you for this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Afterward, while she sat at the table eating her cookie, he watched her in silence.<br> <br>The following morning:<br> <br>CALLER ID BLOCKED.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just wanted to say that it must have been strange, hearing that from me; you must have been reeling&#x2014;that&#x2019;s R-E-E-L-I-N-G, not R-E-A-L-I-N-G, which isn&#x2019;t a bad word, either. What I&#x2019;m saying is that it was meant in the moment, but it doesn&#x2019;t mean anything should change between us. I don&#x2019;t want anything to change. You do what you want and I do what I want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Alice hung up, she was smiling.<br> <br>Then she thought about it a little longer, and she frowned.<br> <br>She was reading the instructions that had come with her watch when her father called to inform her, for the second time that week, that not a single Jew had reported to work in the towers on the day they came down. But the writer did not call her again for many days. Alice slept with her phone next to her pillow and when she wasn&#x2019;t in bed carried it around with her everywhere&#x2014;to the kitchen when she got herself a drink, to the bathroom when she went to the bathroom. Also making her crazy was her toilet seat, the way it slid to ...</p><h2>The Climb: Tragic Ambitions on Everest</h2><p><p><i>Everest</i>, the major motion picture from Universal Pictures, is set for wide release on September 18, 2015. Read <i>The Climb</i>, Anatoli Boukreev (portrayed by Ingvar Sigur�sson in the film) and G. Weston DeWalt&#x2019;s compelling account of those fateful events on Everest.</p><p>In May 1996 three expeditions attempted to climb Mount Everest on the Southeast Ridge route pioneered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Crowded conditions slowed their progress. Late in the day twenty-three men and women-including expedition leaders Scott Fischer and Rob Hall-were caught in a ferocious blizzard. Disoriented and out of oxygen, climbers struggled to find their way down the mountain as darkness approached. Alone and climbing blind, Anatoli Boukreev brought climbers back from the edge of certain death. This new edition includes a transcript of the Mountain Madness expedition debriefing recorded five days after the tragedy, as well as G. Weston DeWalt's response to <i>Into Thin Air </i>author Jon Krakauer.</p></p><p><i>The Climb</i> is Russian mountaineer Anatoli Boukreev's account of the harrowing May 1996 Mount Everest attempt, a tragedy that resulted in the deaths of eight people. The book is also Boukreev's rebuttal to accusations from fellow climber and author Jon Krakauer, who, in his bestselling memoir, <i>Into Thin Air</i>, suggests that Boukreev forfeited the safety of his clients to achieve his own climbing goals. Investigative writer and <i>Climb</i> coauthor G. Weston DeWalt uses taped statements from the surviving climbers and translated interviews from Boukreev to piece together the events and prove to the reader that Boukreev's role was heroic, not opportunistic. Boukreev refers to the actions of expedition leader Scott Fischer throughout the ascent, implying that factors other than the fierce snowstorm may have caused this disaster. This new account sparks debate among both mountaineers and those who have followed the story through the media and Krakauer's book. Readers can decide for themselves whether Boukreev presents a laudable defense or merely assuages his own bruised ego.This newest edition of the bestselling account of the 1996 Everest disaster now includes never before published transcripts of the climbers&#39; debriefing from the Everest base camp. This new material is a must for all followers of the Everest story and includes the climbers first reactions to events.</p><h2>Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science</h2><p>Become a master of audio.This bestselling book has shown thousands of mixing and mastering engineers, musicians, A&amp;R producers how to create great sound.

From the first time she saw a shark in an aquarium, Japanese-American Eugenie was enthralled. Instead of frightening and ferocious eating machines, she saw sleek, graceful fish gliding through the water. After she became a scientist&#x2014;an unexpected career path for a woman in the 1940s&#x2014;she began taking research dives and training sharks, earning her the nickname "The Shark Lady."</p><p>Heather Lang loves to research and write about real women who overcame extraordinary obstacles and never gave up on their dreams. Her picture book biographies include, <i>Swimming with Sharks: The Daring Discoveries of Eugenie Clark, Fearless Flyer: Ruth Law and Her Flying Machine,&nbsp;</i><i>The Original Cowgirl: The Wild Adventures of Lucille Mulhall, </i>and<i>&nbsp;</i><i>Queen of the Track: Alice Coachman, Olympic High-Jump Champion.&nbsp;</i>Heather also writes web articles for the National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance. When she is not writing, she loves to go on adventures with her husband and four children. Visit Heather at heatherlangbooks.com.K-Gr 3&#x2014;This engaging and richly illustrated picture book biography depicts scientist Eugenie Clark's groundbreaking work with sharks. Using clear, kid-friendly prose with just the right amount of scientific detail, Lang introduces readers to Clark as a young child transfixed by sharks at the New York Aquarium. Focused on becoming an ichthyologist (a fish scientist) and undeterred by the lack of women in her field, Clark took every relevant class available, earning a master's degree in zoology. Soon, the ocean was her classroom, and as she explored the underwater world, she collected and observed as much data as she could. In 1955, Clark opened the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Florida, where her work with sharks developed even further, earning her the nickname "Shark Lady." Lang's wonder-filled narrative makes for an inspiring tale of a successful female scientist, with a decided emphasis on her successes. An author's note mentions some discrimination Clark faced as a woman and a Japanese American. However, this is not addressed in the main text. Nevertheless, students will enjoy this account of a scientist's close work with such fearsome creatures. Solano's gorgeous illustrations, done in a soothing, muted palette of greens and blues, suggest the ocean and enhance this selection's appeal.

And then, during the day, the Three Brothers drowned the sky with light. Amri could only hope that his eyes would adjust over time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until that time, the Grottan Gelfling wore his hood, trying to keep his face in shadow even as he followed his companions through the sun-dappled mountain wood. His eyes moved across the moss- and grass-covered earth, like a pelt over the mountain&#x2019;s stone skeleton, whose soggy soil bled into Amri&#x2019;s sandals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through the brightness, Amri caught something stirring in the wood. Whatever lurked ahead was distant enough to be seen but not heard. Were they being watched?<br> &nbsp;<br> He reached out and tugged on Kylan&#x2019;s sleeve. The Spriton boy walked just ahead of him, using a stick to clear brush away from their path. Under his free arm he held a scroll with a map he&#x2019;d drawn, and hanging at his breast was his <i>firca</i>, a Y-shaped musical instrument made out of bone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kylan,&#x201d; Amri whispered. Maybe his new friend&#x2019;s green daylighter eyes could make something out. &#x201c;Do you see something? To our right. Under those trees!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; Kylan lowered his voice instinctively, ears swiveling back and forth, straining for any sign of danger.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What are you two whispering about?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia appeared behind them. She had been farther up the hill, breaking the trail, when she&#x2019;d realized that the others had stopped. Amri wasn&#x2019;t surprised she had returned so stealthily. Dagger in hand, camouflaged in tan and brown leathers, locs pulled back in a loose knot, she was every inch a Drenchen warrior.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somewhere nearby, a twig snapped. Amri drew the sword that hung at his hip, though he had no idea how to use it. Naia ducked to a crouch as six tall white-and-gray animals emerged from the trees, only a stone&#x2019;s throw away. The big-eared creatures&#x2019; long, slender legs carried their furry bodies high among the branches. The beasts grumbled softly to one another, flicking their proboscises to taste the sweet sap that dripped from the wintry trees.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kylan fell back in relief, wiping his brow. &#x201c;Wild Landstriders. And here I thought the Skeksis had found us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri stared at the Landstriders as they passed, trying to absorb every detail of the wondrous creatures. Naia watched him with an amused smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Landstrider rear ends can&#x2019;t be <i>that</i> interesting,&#x201d; she teased.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe not to you. I&#x2019;ve never seen a Landstrider front end, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fair,&#x201d; she chuckled. &#x201c;Well, come on. We&#x2019;ve got to keep moving.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia and Kylan left, forging ahead on their trail without a second glance as the troop of Landstriders disappeared into the wood. Amri wasn&#x2019;t surprised. The others were from this world, after all. Kylan&#x2019;s clan, the Spriton, had named the Landstriders as their sigil creature. Even Naia&#x2019;s clan, the Drenchen of Sog, lived under the sky and had contact with the outside world&#x2014;when they wanted it. Amri, on the other hand, had been born in a cave deep in the Grottan Mountains, only exploring the daylighter world in tiny, forbidden excursions that had to be taken at night.<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia moved with an unbreakable pace, eyes always fixed ahead with focus and determination. As they reached the top of a small wooded hill, the green gave way to a brilliant white. A cold wind came down, smelling of salt and crystal; snow and frost felted bark and every leaf. The cold, white stuff reflected the day even more than before, but even so, Amri couldn&#x2019;t deny it was beautiful. He stooped to touch the wet crystals, squeezing the snow into a melting lump in his hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> A tiny voice sounding of chimes and whispers came from Kylan&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;The frost line means we&#x2019;re near.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Perched in the folds of his collar sat a shining blue creature with eight needle legs. Tavra had lost her Gelfling body&#x2014;that of a Vapra soldier, with iridescent wings and trained hands that had wielded the sword that now waved uselessly in Amri&#x2019;s clumsy grip. She now inhabited the form of a crystal spider.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri sheathed the sword back at his belt before he cut someone with it by accident.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To Ha&#x2019;rar?&#x201d; he asked. He was curious to see the Gelfling capital and its legendary citadel.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To our destination,&#x201d; Tavra replied.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought Ha&#x2019;rar <i>was</i> our destination,&#x201d; Kylan said, raising a brow.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri couldn&#x2019;t make out Tavra&#x2019;s little spider face, but the impatience was evident enough in her voice: &#x201c;Eventually, yes. But we cannot simply charge into the citadel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Amri asked. &#x201c;Do we need to make an appointment or something?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia looked over her shoulder, nodding in agreement as she marched up the mountain slope. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll barge into All-Maudra Mayrin&#x2019;s personal chamber uninvited if I have to,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She needs to know about the Skeksis, and fast. Rian should be here, too. If we find him and get that vial of essence in front of the All-Maudra, there will be no way she can deny the truth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about invitation, Naia,&#x201d; Tavra said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been alone in the wilderness since Kylan sent our message from the Grottan Sanctuary Tree. We have no idea if anyone has received it, much less whether they believe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri shivered. What they&#x2019;d done was monumental, especially if the pink petals dream-stitched with their message had reached each of the seven Gelfling clans. That had been the whole point, after all: to send the warning as far and as fast as possible, so what had happened in the Grottan caves would never happen again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia&#x2019;s pace slowed until she stopped, sighing and putting her hands on her hips. The three of them were quiet so they could hear Tavra&#x2019;s voice over the wind that whistled through the snowy pines.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Naia, Kylan. Amri. I know you want to reach Ha&#x2019;rar. What the Skeksis have done&#x2014;are doing&#x2014;is a horrible crime and must be stopped. But the Gelfling have lived in the hand of the Skeksis for generations. It is not easy to change the way things are. People are learning our names and faces. But like Rian, we will be known as traitors. Not heroes. For this reason, we must be cautious, even with my mother. We must understand the weather before we inadvertently walk into a blizzard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think your mother might still side with the Skeksis, even if she saw that vial of essence?&#x201d; Amri asked. The idea was a disheartening one. &#x201c;Even if she saw what happened in Domrak&#x2014;saw what happened to you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Belief is only half of the task we face,&#x201d; Tavra replied.<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia&#x2019;s eagerness deflated, her green ears flattening.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Then what should we do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We could disguise ourselves as Podlings and sneak into the citadel,&#x201d; Amri suggested, trying to lighten the mood. Being so serious all the time was exhausting. &#x201c;Spy on the All-Maudra from the rafters. Oh, I guess Podlings wouldn&#x2019;t be very good climbers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia laughed, and even Kylan cracked a grin. Tavra, as usual, had no sense of humor about any of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Chase the scent of the sea,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When you see the seafarer&#x2019;s lanterns, follow them down the cliff to the shore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As they heeded Tavra&#x2019;s directions, the earthy trail gave way to more snow and stone. The cliffs and mountain forms shimmered and glittered, like smoothed crystal reflecting the bright blue of the sky. Amri had never experienced the scent of the sea. He wasn&#x2019;t sure what to expect. But when a draft of salty air gusted across their path, there was no mistaking it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Smells like it&#x2019;s coming from that mountainside,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia nodded, looking the wall of rock up and down.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pretty steep,&#x201d; she remarked. Amri didn&#x2019;t think so, but then again, rocks were his specialty. Maybe his only specialty. It didn&#x2019;t matter, anyway. If his friends couldn&#x2019;t follow, then there was no point to making the climb. That much could have been said of their entire journey.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a passage through,&#x201d; Tavra said. &#x201c;That way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They waded through the snow, into the shadow cast by the cliff. For a grand moment, Amri&#x2019;s eyes had a rest from squinting, though it wasn&#x2019;t for long. A spot of light shone through the trees. They followed it, in moments finding a low tunnel through the rock. Amri traced his fingers along the tunnel wall as they walked through it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so smooth, like you were polished,&#x201d; he said to the stone, falling behind a step or three. Naia and Kylan were more interested in reaching the other side. He pressed his hand against the glossy surface, soaking in the cold of it and closing his eyes. &#x201c;What made you? Hm?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you talking to the wall?&#x201d; Naia called back to him, over her shoulder. She and Kylan stood at the end of the tunnel, their silhouettes the only relief from the blasting of the daylight. &#x201c;Come on, crawly-foot!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri sighed and gave the wall a goodbye pat. He hurried down the tunnel, grunting when he slipped on the icy path. Normally the tunnel would be no problem for a Grottan like him, used to caves and rock, but the sandals strapped on his feet made him clumsy. <i>Crawly-foot indeed.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When he reached the other side of the tunnel and stopped beside Naia and Kylan, all he could see was blue. An endless ocean stretched below, the texture of living granite. The tunnel opened like a mouth, its tongue a steep, rocky trail that wound down to the coast. There was no snow here. Instead, thick silver mist glittered and swirled, broken only by the tops of a few tall trees that grew along the shore. The mist must have frozen into snow as it passed over the top of the ridge, Amri guessed. The mist that had given the Silver Sea its name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kylan tilted his head when he caught sight of a peculiar rock sitting just outside the tunnel&#x2019;s opening, nearly touching his left hand. On the rock, a carving in the likeness of a scaled, finned sea creature peered at them. Jewels were set in its head as eyes, reflecting the golden flame in the lantern hanging out of its mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Seafarer&#x2019;s lantern,&#x201d; Tavra said, as if it explained everything.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who keeps the lantern fires lit?&#x201d; Amri asked. He knelt by it, looking into its old, shining eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one knows. Old mauddies tell the song of a water spirit that lights the lanterns to lure childlings into the sea. More likely they&#x2019;re kept lit by travelers. However it happens, their lights have led sailors and travelers for hundreds of trine. Showing the way up the coast to Ha&#x2019;rar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Come, then. Down we go, along the stone&#x2019;s way for the sake of you two boys.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri exchanged a glance with Kylan. The Spriton shrugged and, as the spider on his shoulder said, began the long descent. Amri could see Naia&#x2019;s black-and-indigo wings twitch as she looked over the cliff into the open air above the mist.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You could glide down and we&#x2019;ll meet you,&#x201d; he suggested.<br> &nbsp;<br> She smiled. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sure you could easily climb down the cliff if you kicked off those shoes. That would just leave poor Kylan alone with Tavra&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Here she winked and added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m used to the stone&#x2019;s way. We&#x2019;ll go together.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It would have been nice to have wings, though the idea of drifting through the open sky sounded a bit terrifying, too. Amri preferred the ground, even if the path was gravelly and loose under his sandals. When his foot slipped out from under him, Naia grabbed his hand to keep him from tumbling down the side of the ledge. She righted him and he sighed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, ears twisting back in embarrassment. None of the others seemed to be having the same problems, but they were all used to the sandals. It was a daylighter thing. Naia only smiled, the corners of her eyes soft with sympathy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Walk heel-first,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And keep your back straight. It&#x2019;ll help with balance.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He tried it, and they followed Kylan together. Heel-first felt unnatural. Dangerous, like he was going to step on something sharp at any moment. Walking toe-first made more sense, barefoot in the caves where any step could turn sharp and painful. But that was what the sandals were for.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I had the same problem when I first left Sog,&#x201d; Naia added. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get the hang of it. You&#x2019;re already better than when you first started.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri tried to imagine Naia getting used to shoes for the first time. &#x201c;Even so, it&#x2019;ll only take one slip to go tumbling into the sea. And I&#x2019;ll bet this far north that water&#x2019;s cold as a Vapra&#x2019;s kiss,&#x201d; he said with a grin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia chuckled, then realized she was still holding his hand. She let go, leaving a cold spot in his palm. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve kissed how many Vapra?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri had never kissed anyone, let alone the one Vapra he&#x2019;d ever met. Who also happened to be a spider.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, so many,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So many.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When they finally reached sea level, Amri&#x2019;s knees ached. The forest thinned as the land ended in a rocky shore where the ocean&#x2019;s waves rolled up the land. The stones that washed up from the sea were round and smooth, in shades of black and silver and blue. Amri wanted to stoop down and bury his hands in them, close his eyes and listen to their tales. But his friends were already on the move, Kylan pointing to another lantern monument ahead, a spot of gold in all the silver mist.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something small and pink flitted by. Amri caught the petal in his hand, and memories sprouted in his mind. A forest full of shadows and whispers and a terrible monster. A huge tree in the Dark Wood called Olyeka-Staba&#x2014;the Cradle Tree&#x2014;calling out in agony as its roots touched poison in the ground. The wild red eyes of the Skeksis Hunter as he chased Kylan and Naia&#x2014;his confession on that terrible night that echoed the screams of the Skeksis back in the castle: that they had found a way to make a life-giving elixir by draining essence from the Gelfling. The Gelfling, who had served the Skeksis with unquestioning loyalty for hundreds of trine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri opened his hand and let the petal free before the dream could take root and fully blossom. He didn&#x2019;t need to see all the awful memories again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They made it to the coast after all,&#x201d; Naia said, watching it fly away. &#x201c;I wonder if they&#x2019;ve gone all the way to Ha&#x2019;rar.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amri tried to let the memories fly away, too. Tried to replace them with what was in front of him: Naia, whose smile was undaunted. Who had healed Olyeka-Staba and eased its pain in the Dark Wood. Who had faced the Skeksis without fear, and had seen the darkened Heart of Thra and survived.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; Amri said. &#x201c;Hey, Kylan! Wait up!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kylan slowed, staring out into the fog that rolled in off the sea. As Amri and Naia caught up to him, a shadow shivered into view. It was a ship, tied to a big tree that leaned out over the water.

Award-winning artist David McPhail&#x2019;s whimsical illustrations reflect the beauty of the world around us as Lloyd-Jones&#x2019; inspirational text prompts readers to celebrate the changing seasons and the miracle of nature&#x2019;s rebirth.</p></p><p><p>Sally Lloyd-Jones is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling writer and frequent performer of her work. She has written over 25 books, spanning the Christian and the general markets. Her work has been critically acclaimed by both the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>.

In lyrical, soothing prose, the text follows the brown bunny through the four seasons, noting his observations of the changes in nature. The bunny is concerned by the changes he sees in the fall and by the seemingly dead appearance of trees, grass and flowers in winter. His parents and other animals reassure the bunny about the cycle of rebirth, and the bunny celebrates his springtime birthday with joy. Although the story can be interpreted as a Christian parable, there is no overt religious content until the final page, which includes a paraphrased quotation from Martin Luther about God's promise of new life being revealed in springtime as well as in books, presumably the Bible. (The actual quotation is not included.) Due to the mostly secular appearance of the story, this odd placement means the book is likely to be overlooked by readers looking for religious approaches to springtime stories. Delicate watercolor illustrations in McPhail's distinctive style are filled with delightful details and varied seasonal perspectives, as well as appealing rabbits and other creatures. The concluding quotation and the subtext of rebirth make this an oh-so-subtle Easter title that readers may well miss. (Picture book/religion. 3-6) (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>A Martin Luther quote ends this book, reminding readers that God has written the promise of new life in every springtime leaf. But in the beginning, there is a bunny, born in the spring, who sees that &#x201c;the earth is new, like me.&#x201d; As other newly born animals take their first steps or fly from the nest, the bunny notices the beauty of the world. As the seasons change, the bunny becomes attuned to the cycle of life, though, at times, it frightens him: the world seems to be dying before his eyes. &#x201c;And Yet-And Yet!&#x201d; the woodpecker taps. Sure enough, after a winter&#x2019;s sleep, the bunny understands that life can be resurrected from apparent death, and the sun&#x2019;s warmth can return to gladden hearts. McPhail&#x2019;s ink-and-watercolor artwork displays both the innocence and concern that come as the bunny begins to understand that the world is complicated, and it culminates in the joy of fresh beginning. Although this can be read on a secular level, young Christian children will see overtones of the Jesus story in Lloyd-Jones&#x2019; comforting words.

But ghosts don&#x2019;t open doors. They will, on occasion, ask me to open one, so I can raise and interrogate the zombies of supernaturals killed by a mad scientist, but they never need one opened for themselves.<br><br>I sat up in bed and rubbed my bleary eyes, blinking away the lingering fog of the sedative. For a moment, the door stayed open only a crack. I slid from the bed, tiptoeing across the thick carpet of my fake hotel room, praying the person on the other side had been called away and I could escape before these people started whatever experiments they&#x2019;d brought me here to &#x2013;<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Chloe.&#x201d; Dr. Davidoff beamed his best kindly-old-man smile as he pushed the door wide. He wasn&#x2019;t that old &#x2013; maybe fifty &#x2013; but in a movie, I&#x2019;d cast him as the doddering absent-minded scientist. It was an act I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;d worked on until he got it just right.<br><br>The woman behind him had chic blond hair and a New York suit. I&#x2019;d cast her as the mother of the nastiest girl in class. Which was cheating, because that&#x2019;s exactly who she was. Mother of Victoria &#x2013; Tori &#x2013; Enright, the one housemate we&#x2019;d left out of our plans when we&#x2019;d escaped from Lyle House, and for good cause, considering she was one of the reasons I&#x2019;d needed to escape.<br><br>Tori&#x2019;s mom carried a Macy&#x2019;s bag, like she&#x2019;d just been out shopping and popped in to conduct a few horrific experiments before heading to lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;I know you have a lot of questions, Chloe,&#x201d; Dr. Davidoff said as I sat on the edge of the bed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to answer them for you. We just need a little help from you first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Simon and Derek,&#x201d; Mrs. Enright said. &#x201c;Where are they?&#x201d;<br><br>I looked from her to Dr. Davidoff, who smiled and nodded encouragingly, like he fully expected me to turn in my friends.<br><br>I&#x2019;d never been an angry kid. I&#x2019;d never run away from home. Never stamped my feet and screamed that life was unfair and I wished I&#x2019;d never been born. Whenever my dad told me we were moving again and I needed to transfer schools, I&#x2019;d swallowed a whiny &#x201c;but I just made new friends,&#x201d; nod, and tell him I understood.<br><br>Accept your lot. Count your blessings. Be a big girl.<br><br>Now, looking back at a life of doing what I was told, I realized I&#x2019;d bought into the game. When adults patted me on the head and told me I was so grown-up, what they really meant was that they were glad I wasn&#x2019;t grown-up enough yet to question, to fight back.<br><br>Looking at Dr. Davidoff and Mrs. Enright, I thought of what they&#x2019;d done to me &#x2013; lying to me, locking me up &#x2013; and I <i>wanted </i>to stamp my feet. Wanted to scream. But I wasn&#x2019;t going to give them that satisfaction.<br><br>I widened my eyes as I met Mrs. Enright&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;You mean you haven&#x2019;t found them yet?&#x201d;<br><br>I think she would have slapped me if Dr. Davidoff hadn&#x2019;t lifted his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;No, Chloe, we haven&#x2019;t found the boys,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re very concerned for Simon&#x2019;s safety.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because you think Derek might hurt him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not intentionally, of course. I know Derek&#x2019;s fond of Simon.&#x201d;<br><i><br>Fond? </i>What a strange word to use. Derek and Simon were foster brothers, tighter than any blood brothers I knew. Sure, Derek was a werewolf, but that wolf part of him was what would <i>stop </i>him from ever hurting Simon. He&#x2019;d protect him at all costs &#x2013; I&#x2019;d already seen that.<br><br>My skepticism must have shown on my face, because Dr. Davidoff shook his head, as if disappointed in me. &#x201c;All right, Chloe. If you can&#x2019;t spare any concern for Simon&#x2019;s safety, maybe you can for his health.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;W-what ab-bou&#x2013;&#x201d; My stutter cropped up most when I was nervous, and I couldn&#x2019;t let them know they&#x2019;d struck a nerve. So I tried again, slower now. &#x201c;What about his health?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His condition.&#x201d;<br><br>Apparently I wasn&#x2019;t the only one who watched too many movies. Now they would tell me that Simon had some rare medical condition and if he didn&#x2019;t get his medicine within twelve hours, he&#x2019;d spontaneously combust.<br><br>&#x201c;What condition?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has diabetes,&#x201d; Dr. Davidoff said. &#x201c;His blood sugar levels need to be monitored and regulated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With one of those blood testing things?&#x201d; I said slowly, thinking back. Simon had always disappeared into the bathroom before meals. I&#x2019;d thought he just liked to wash up. I&#x2019;d bumped into him once coming out as he&#x2019;d been shoving a small black case into his pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Dr. Davidoff said. &#x201c;With proper care, diabetes is easily managed. You weren&#x2019;t aware of it because you didn&#x2019;t need to be. Simon leads a normal life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Except for one thing,&#x201d; Tori&#x2019;s mom said.<br><br>She reached into the Macy&#x2019;s bag and took out a backpack. It looked like Simon&#x2019;s, but I wasn&#x2019;t falling for that &#x2013; they&#x2019;d probably bought a matching one. Sure, she pulled out a hoodie I recognized as Simon&#x2019;s, but he&#x2019;d left behind a whole closet of clothing at Lyle House. Easy enough to grab stuff from there.<br><br>Next came a pad of paper and pouch of colored pencils. Simon&#x2019;s room was filled with his comic book sketches. Again, easy enough to &#x2013;<br><br>Mrs. Enright flipped through the sketch pad, holding up pages. Simon&#x2019;s work in progress. He&#x2019;d never have left that behind.<br><br>Finally, she laid a flashlight on the table. The flashlight from Lyle House &#x2013; the one I&#x2019;d watched him put into his bag.<br><br>&#x201c;Simon slipped going over the fence,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He had his backpack over one shoulder. It fell. Our people were right behind him so he had to leave it. There&#x2019;s something in here that Simon needs much more than clothing and art supplies.&#x201d;<br><br>She opened a navy nylon pouch. Inside were two penlike vials, one filled with cloudy liquid, the other clear. &#x201c;The insulin to replace what Simon&#x2019;s body can&#x2019;t produce. He injects himself with these three times a day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What happens if he doesn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Davidoff took over. &#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t going to scare you and say that if Simon skips a single shot, he&#x2019;ll die. He&#x2019;s already missed his morning one, and I&#x2019;m sure he only feels a bit out of sorts. But by tomorrow, he&#x2019;ll be vomiting. In about three days, he&#x2019;ll lapse into a diabetic coma.&#x201d; He took the pouch from Tori&#x2019;s mom and set it in front of me. &#x201c;We need to get this to Simon.

The first "graphic history book" of its kind, The Story of the Jews celebrates the major characters and events that have shaped the Jewish people and culture, illustrating what it means to be Jewish. You will visit all the major Jewish happenings from biblical times to the twenty-first century&#x2015;from Abraham and Sarah on the banks of the Euphrates to the Diaspora, intermarriage, and the State of Israel. Moses receiving the Ten Commandments, The triumph of King David, The creation of the Talmud, The rise of Christianity and Islam, The Crusades, The Inquisition, The Enlightenment, Life in the new Babylon (the United States), The birth of the state of Israel, And&#x2015;of course&#x2015;the world's first &#x201c;Oy!&#x201d;</p></p><p>For every Talmudic scholar there are 10 well-intended souls who can't scan a page of Genesis without snoring. But thanks to Stan Mack, the history of the Jews is accessible to anyone who's ever succeeded in reading the comics. With humor, biblical quotes, cartoon sketches, historical accuracy, and an irreverent tone, Mack sums up 4,000 years of Jewish history in a fast-paced, delightful narrative. So a few incidents and details get lost along the way--more important is that what's included actually gets read, because Mack's style and drawings are so beguiling. From Abraham's covenant with God and the introduction of monotheism (a Jewish soldier instructs a Canaanite at sword point, saying "Y'see, our God isn't really fighting your God because our God is your God and your God isn't really a God because...") to today's diverse denominations ("My synagogue is unaffiliated. Our members have an equal say, are nonideological, and have low dues"), Mack's quips and sketches cover a lot of ground, from the Exodus, Romans, Christians and Moslems, onward. He sashays through ghettos and shtetls, illustrates Europe's anti-Semitism and Zionist fever, breezes through immigration to the U.S., WWII, and the establishment of Israel, ending with Jewish culture in the late 20th century. Backed by an index (which makes this a reference instead of a comic book) and a savvy political cartoonist's eye for irony, Mack's book emanates a fondness for his subject. And he tells a good story. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i><br>"Funny and original, and it won't take 4,000 years to read."<br>--Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons<br><br>"Veteran cartoonist Stan Mack brings his hip, contemporary sensibility to bear upon the sacred precincts of Jewish history and the result is, unexpectedly, a joy to behold. The artful and varied drawings breathe an air of enchantment that will both beguile and instruct children, while the often mischievous asides and commentary should bring a knowing smile to the lips of the most sophisticated adults. By sweeping away the cobwebs from Jewish history, Stan Mack has taken something familiar and made it fresh, piquant, and appealing to people of all ages."<br>--Ron Chernow, author of The Warburgs<br><br>"The work is wonderful! What a refreshing view of the story. I didn't want it to end."<br>--Leonard Nimoy<br><br>"No mordant minimalism, The Story of the Jews; Stan Mack puts it all out there, in a wonderfully funny and enlightening way."<br>--Ann Beattie, author of Another You<br><br>"Profound congratulations to Stan Mack on authoring this singular and most-needed history of the Jewish people. To say that it is highly readable and extremely enjoyable is understating the obvious. The work presents concepts and ideas that, for other authors, might take pages or chapters to explain. But Stan Mack, through his imaginative drawings, delivers the concepts and convictions of the Jewish people in a charming and engrossing style. Mazel tov: we really needed this opus to supplement all the other long and stodgy Jewish history books."<br>--Rabbi Lawrence Goldmark, president, the Board of Rabbis of Southern California <br></p><h2>Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith</h2><p><p><em>Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith</em> is available in time for the Aerosmith's 40th Anniversary. It's the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling autobiography by the legendary rock group that lived by the motto "Anything worth doing was worth overdoing." Aerosmith shook the music world out of its '70s doldrums...and made living on the edge an art form. <em>Walk This Way</em> is the complete and candid story of their meteoric rise to fame, their near destruction due to drugs and excess, and their return to the stage as one of America's greatest rock bands. Cowritten by respected rock journalist Stephen Davis, author of the seminal profile of Led Zeppelin, <em>Hammer of the Gods</em>, and with a new afterward from the band, this edition of the memoir to end all rock memoirs is the perfect&nbsp; gift for you and your favorite Aerosmith fan.</p></p><p>From Aerosmith's heyday in the late 1970s, which they spent "gacked to the nines" (as lead singer Steven Tyler puts it), to the Aerosmith of today--clean, sober, and adored by millions--the band has a long, hard history. <i>Walk This Way</i> chronicles the whole story: drugs, booze, and all. <p> Prefaced with the now familiar rock-star "intervention," when Steven Tyler's loved ones cornered him in his manager's office in 1986, the autobiography traces Aerosmith's twisted road, from their New Hampshire roots to their success in Boston to the worldwide fame that they long craved and currently enjoy. Tyler kicks off this rock &amp; roll expos�, briefly recounting the history of his ancestors in Italy and sharing incidents from his own Northeast childhood.

From interior designers Charlotte Moss, Suzanne Rheinstein, and Bunny Williams, and event designer Tara Guerard to floral and garden experts Sybil Sylvester and P.

Wrong. Ilan Stavans, a literary scholar and cultural historian, teams up with Chicano artist Lalo Alcaraz to craft an endlessly entertaining but painstakingly researched history of Latinos--also called Latin Americans and Hispanics, and taking in peoples from all over the Spanish-speaking world--in the United States. Stavans's text covers the ground from avocados to zoot suits, touching on such matters as the Puerto Rican independence movement, the Mexican American War, the Marielito flotilla, and the ongoing struggle for civil rights throughout the hemisphere.<p> Stavans has great fun, it's clear, twitting received wisdom. He observes, for instance, that Mexico's "Ni�os Heroes" may be an invention of folklore, and wryly remarks that "nationalism turns egotism into an ideology." Alcaraz has just as much fun, subversively borrowing stock figures such as the toucan (a symbol in much Latin American literature) and the skeleton to serve as a kind of ironic Greek chorus. But author and illustrator also fulfill an earnestly undertaken mission: namely, in Stavans's words, to "represent Hispanic civilization as a fiesta of types, archetypes, and stereotypes" and to tell its story from many points of view. In this they succeed admirably, and <i>Latino U.S.A.</i> is required reading for anyone interested in democratic, inclusive historical writing. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Ilan Stavans</b>, one of today's preeminent essayists, cultural critics, and translators is Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture and Five College-Fortieth Anniversary Professor at Amherst College. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, his work has been translated into a dozen languages.<br><br><b>Lalo Alcaraz </b>is the prolific creator of the nationally-syndicated political comic-strip "La Cucaracha" as well as an award-winning editorial cartoonist and radio host.

Then again...Sedaris reads her own work, which is only logical since no one else could do it justice. With her slight Southern twang, she delivers a breezy, witty winner.

The 100 flavor-packed recipes here include many of The Peached Tortilla&#x2019;s most-beloved dishes, like the Banh Mi Taco, JapaJam Burger, and Bacon Jam Fries, which gained rabid fandom when Silverstein first served them out of his famed Austin-based food truck. Other crowd-pleasing favorites range from crispy Umami Fried Chicken and Korean Short Rib Pappardelle with Smoked Cr�me Fra�che to Asian Pear Miso Salad and Roasted Cauliflower with Nori Brown Butter. This is Asian fusion at its best, delivering soul-satisfying comfort food with a kick!</p><p>Born in Tokyo, Eric Silverstein became immersed in Japanese food culture as a child. When his family moved to Atlanta, GA, he fell in love with Southern cooking.

With Kelly &amp; Michael</i>, Food Network, and The Cooking Channel. Silverstein opened his first brick-and-mortar restaurant, The Peached Tortilla, in Austin, TX, in 2014 (named by <i>The</i><i>New York Times</i> as &#x201c;One of the Five Places to Go in Austin&#x201d;). In 2016, Silverstein opened Peached Social House, a one-of-a-kind event and catering space, and in&nbsp;2018, he opened&nbsp;The Peached Tortilla&#x2019;s first fast-casual&nbsp;restaurant in Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.&#x201c;Silverstein, born in Tokyo and raised in Atlanta, operated food trucks in Austin before opening The Peached Tortilla in 2014, and here he offers 100 tantalizing recipes that combine the flavors of the American South with those of Asia. Southern staples with a savory twist include umami fried chicken, which is marinated in fish sauce and red wine vinegar then battered in rice flour, and kimchi queso, in which pureed spicy cabbage melds with melted Velveeta. Among a large array of street food&#x2013;inspired dishes are Chinese BBQ pork tacos topped with an Asian slaw, and char kway teow, a Malaysian mix of shrimp and noodles in a tangy sauce. The chef&#x2019;s affection for a certain cut of beef, meanwhile, is evident in kung pao brisket, BBQ brisket tacos, and brisket hash, among many others. There is an extensive chapter on pickles and sauces, which form the flavor foundation for many of the dishes, and a handy glossary that lists various noodles such as the flat Vietnamese banh pho and the Chinese ho fun, ideal for stir fries.

The wedding is a lavish affair&#x2013;for the marriage of Dylan Buchanan and Kate MacKenna is no ordinary occasion. It represents the joining of two family dynasties. The ceremony and reception proceed without a hitch&#x2013;until a crasher appears claiming to be a MacKenna guest. The disheveled and eccentric professor of medieval history warns that there&#x2019;s &#x201c;bad blood&#x201d; between the couple&#x2019;s clans, stemming from an ancient feud that originated in Scotland, and involving the Buchanan theft of a coveted MacKenna treasure.<br><br>Jordan has always led a cautious life and has used her intelligence and reason to become a successful businesswoman. So she is intrigued but skeptical of the professor&#x2019;s claims that the feud has been kept alive by the grave injustices the Buchanans have perpetrated over the centuries. But when Noah Clayborne, a close family friend and a man who has never let a good time or a pretty girl pass him by, accuses Jordan of being trapped in her comfort zone, she determines to prove him wrong and sets out on a spontaneous adventure to the small, dusty town of Serenity, Texas, to judge the professor&#x2019;s research for herself.<br><br>Maneuvering through a close-knit community in which everyone knows everyone else&#x2019;s business, Jordan never anticipates the danger and intrigue that lie in her path, nor the threat that will shadow her back to Boston, where even in familiar surroundings, her life is at risk.<br><br>A powerful thug who rules by fear, a man who harbors a simmering secret, and an unexpected romance that pierces all defenses&#x2013;beloved author Julie Garwood weaves these dazzling elements into a brilliant novel of romantic suspense. Shadow Dance is a searing tango of passion and peril.</p><p>Julie Garwood is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including Slow Burn, Murder List, Killjoy, Mercy, Heartbreaker, Ransom, and Come the Spring. There are more than thirty-two million copies of her books in print.<i>The wedding of Jordan Buchanan's brother Dylan to her best friend, Kate MacKenna, was a joyous occasion, and the reception a beautiful affair --<br></i><br>Jordan walked into the ballroom and stood near the entrance trying to find Noah in the crowd on the dance floor. He still had her glasses in his pocket and her contacts were bothering her.<br><br>"What's got you frowning?"<br><br>Her brother Nick asked the question as he sauntered over to her.<br><br>"I'm not frowning. I&#x2019;m squinting. Noah has my glasses. Do you see him?"<br><br>"Yeah. He's right in front of you."<br><br>She focused in, spotted him, and then did frown. "Look at those silly women panting all over your partner. It's disgusting."<br><br>"You think?"<br><br>"I think," she replied. "Promise me something."<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"If I ever act like that, you'll shoot me."<br><br>"Be happy to," Nick promised before laughing at her.<br><br>Noah had excused himself from his fan club and walked over to join them.<br><br>"What so funny?"<br><br>"Jordan wants me to shoot her."<br><br>Noah glanced down at her, and for a second or two she had his full, undivided attention. <br><br>"I'll do it," he offered<br><br>There was a little too much glee in his voice to suit her. She had just decided to walk away from the two of them when she spotted Dan Robbins heading her way. At least she thought it was Dan. He was too blurry to be sure. She&#x2019;d had one dance with Dan earlier in the evening, and no matter what music was playing, whether it was a waltz, a tango, or hip hop, Dan bounced to his own tune in something that resembled a spasmodic version of a polka. Jordan changed her mind and stayed put. She moved a little closer to Noah and smiled at him. The ploy seemed to work. Dan hesitated and then turned away.<br><br>"Don't you want to know why she wants me to shoot her?" Nick asked.<br><br>"I already know why," Noah said. "She's bored."<br><br>She slipped her hand into his pocket, found her glasses, and put them on.<br><br>"I am not bored."<br><br>"Yes, you are," Noah said.<br><br>He was looking over her head when he spoke to her. She suspected he did it on purpose just to irritate her.<br><br>"He's right," Nick said. "You have to be bored. All you had was your company, and since you sold everything..."<br><br>"Your point?"<br><br>Nick shrugged. "You've got to be bored."<br><br>"Just because I don't like the same things you two do doesn't mean I'm bored or unhappy. I have a wonderful social life and&#x2013;"<br><br>Noah cut her off. "Dead people have a better social life."<br><br>Nick agreed. "You really don't have much fun, do you?"<br><br>"Of course I do. I enjoy reading and..."<br><br>They were both grinning at her. They were obnoxious clowns, and she was about to tell them so when Nick said, "She does like a good book. What was it you were reading a couple of days ago?"<br><br>"I don't remember. I read lots of books."<br><br>"I do," Noah said, his voice gratingly cheerful. "Nick and Dylan and I had just gotten back from fishing, and you were sitting on the deck reading the complete works of Stephen Hawkings."<br><br>"It was riveting."<br><br>They had a good laugh over her defensive comment. "Stop making fun of me and go away. Both of you."<br><br>Her timing could have been better. As soon as she told them to leave, she spotted Dan approaching her again. She grabbed hold of Noah's arm. She was sure he knew what she was doing and why&#x2013;he'd have to be blind not to notice Dan strolling toward them&#x2013;but he didn't say anything about it.<br><br>"Your sister lives in a box," said Noah.<br><br>Nick agreed. "Jordan, when was the last time you did anything just for fun?'<br><br>"I do lots of things for fun."<br><br>"Let me qualify that question. When did you do anything fun that didn't involve computers or computer chips or software?"<br><br>She opened her mouth to answer and then closed it. She couldn't think of anything, but surely that was only because she was under pressure.<br><br>"Have you ever done anything impractical?" Noah asked.<br><br>"Where's the logic in that?" she asked.<br><br>Noah turned to Nick. "Is she serious?" <br><br>"Afraid so," Nick answered. "Before my sister would ever consider doing anything on the spur of the moment, she would have to first analyze all the data, then figure the statistical probabilities of success..."<br><br>The two men were having a fine time tormenting her and would have continued if their employer, Doctor Peter Morganstern, hadn't joined them. He carried a plate with two pieces of wedding cake.<br><br>Morganstern had become a good friend of the family and wouldn't have missed the wedding for anything in the world. Jordan liked and admired him. He was a brilliant forensic psychiatrist who ran a highly specialized unit operating within the FBI. They called it the lost and found department. Her brother Nick and Noah were part of Morganstern's program. Among their responsibilities was finding lost and exploited children, and Jordan believed they were a substantial reason for the program's success.<br><br>"You three seem to be enjoying yourselves."<br><br>"How do you stand working with them?" Jordan asked.<br><br>"There are moments when I question my sanity. Especially with this one," he said, tilting his head toward Noah.<br><br>"Sir, I'm sorry you and your wife got stuck at the same table with our Aunt Iris," Nick said. "Did she find out you were a doctor?"<br><br>"I'm afraid so, yes."<br><br>"Iris is an obsessive hypochondriac," he explained to Noah.<br><br>"What are the odds the doctor would get stuck sitting next to her?" Noah asked.<br><br>Everyone turned toward Morgantern&#x2019;s table where Aunt Iris sat. <br><br>"One chance in one hundred seventy-nine thousand seven hundred," Jordan answered before she could stop herself.<br><br>The men turned back now to look at her.<br><br>Astonished, the doctor asked, "Is that an exact number or a guess?' <br><br>"An exact number based on six hundred guests," she said. "I never guess."<br><br>"Does she do this kind of stuff all the time?" Noah wondered aloud.<br><br>"Pretty much," Nick answered.<br><br>"Just because I have a mind for math&#x2013;"<br><br>"But with no common sense," Nick finished.<br><br>"I could certainly use you on my team," Morganstern said. "If you ever consider a change in careers, come work for me."<br><br>"No," Nick said emphatically.<br><br>"Absolutely not," Noah said at the same time.<br><br>The doctor turned his head toward Jordan and gave her a conspiratorial wink. "I wouldn't put her in the field right away. Like you two, she would need extensive training." He looked as though he were pondering the possibility for a second or two and then said, "I've got a good feeling about Jordan. I believe she'd be an asset to the unit."<br><br>"Sir, isn't there a rule against two members of the same family working together?"<br><br>"I don't have that rule," Morganstern said. "I wouldn't make her go through the academy. I'd train her myself."<br><br>Noah looked appalled. "Sir, it still isn't a good idea," he insisted while Nick vigorously nodded agreement.<br><br>Exasperated, Jordan turned to Noah and said, "Listen, Mister Butinski. This isn't your decision. It's mine."<br><br>The doctor seemed fascinated by Noah's reaction to his proposal.<br><br>"Would I get to carry a gun?" she asked.<br><br>"A gun is out of the question," Nick said.<br><br>&#x201c;You're too uncoordinated and you&#x2019;re blind as a bat," Noah interjected. "You&#x2019;d shoot yourself,&#x201d; he predicted.<br><br>She smiled at Morganstern. "It was lovely talking to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get away from these two cretins."<br><br>Noah grabbed her arm. "Come on. Dance with me."<br><br>Since he was already dragging her toward the dance floor, she felt it would be pointless to argue. The bride had coaxed her sister into singing. Isabel had the most wonderful voice, and when she began to sing Kate's favorite ballad, a hush fell over the crowd. Young and old, they were all mesmerized by her.<br><br>Noah pulled Jordan into his arms and held her tight against him. She had to admit it wasn't completely unpleasant. She did like the feel of his hard body pressed against hers. She liked his scent too. Whatever he was wearing was ruggedly sexy.<br><br>He was looking over the top of her head when he asked, "You wouldn't really consider working for the doctor, would you?"<br><br>He actually sounded a little worried. She couldn't resist provoking him just a little. "Only if I get to work with you."<br><br>He smiled as he shook his head. "Not gonna happen. And you can't really be serious, right?"<br><br>"Right," she agreed. "I wouldn't consider working for Doctor Morganstern. Happy now?"<br><br>"I'm always happy."<br><br>She rolled her eyes. Oh, brother. The ego. "By the way," she said, "Doctor Morganstern wasn't serious. He was teasing to get a rise out of you and Nick. It worked too. You did get riled."<br><br>"The doctor never teases, and I never get riled."<br><br>"Okay, even if he wasn't teasing, I still wouldn't consider working for him."<br><br>He flashed a smile, and for a fleeting second she forgot how irritating he could be.<br><br>"I didn't think you would be interested."<br><br>Annoyed, she asked, "Then why are we having this conversation? If you knew the answer, why did you ask?"<br><br>"Just making sure. That's all."<br><br>They swayed to the music for a good half a minute, and she was actually feeling relaxed when he ruined it.<br><br>"You'd be terrible at it, by the way."<br><br>"It?"<br><br>"The job."<br><br>"How would you know if I'd be good or bad?"<br><br>"You live in a comfort zone. That's how I know."<br><br>"I'll bite. What's a comfort zone?"<br><br>"It's where you live. You never step outside your safe environment, your comfort zone," he explained. "You stay in the shadows." Before she could object, he said, "I'll bet you've never done anything in your entire life that was spontaneous, or taken any risks."<br><br>"I've taken plenty of risks in the past year alone."<br><br>"Yeah? Name one."<br><br>&#x201c;I sold my company.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was a calculated decision and you netted a huge profit,&#x201d; he countered. &#x201c;What else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been doing a lot of running. I thought I&#x2019;d try for the Boston Marathon next year,&#x201d; she offered.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a regimen, requires discipline. Plus, you do it to stay fit,&#x201d; he argued. <br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t looking over her head now. He was staring into her eyes, and he was making her extremely uncomfortable. For the life of her, she couldn't think of a single spontaneous action or risk she'd ever taken. Everything she did was well thought out and planned down to the last detail. Was her life really that boring? Was <i>she</i> that boring?<br><br>"Having trouble coming up with one?"<br><br>"There's nothing wrong with being careful." Great, now she sounded like a ninety year old.<br><br>He looked like he was about to laugh. "You're right," he said. "Nothing wrong with being careful."<br><br>Embarrassed because she had only just realized how dull she was, and guessing that he had already figured that out about her as well, she hurriedly changed the subject to get the focus off of herself. She blurted out the first thought that came into her mind.<br><br>"Isabel has a great voice, doesn't she? I could listen to her all night. Did you know she's been hounded by agents wanting to make her a star. She's not interested though. She's only a freshman, but she's already decided she wants to be a history major, then get her masters and teach. Interesting, don't you think? She's giving up fame and fortune. I think that's amazing, don't you?"<br><br>Noah gave her a piercing smile that went right through her, but he looked puzzled as well. No wonder. She was babbling like a toddler. She knew she should stop talking, but she couldn't seem to make herself close her mouth. Thanks to his scrutiny she had a bad, bad case of nerves.<br><br>For the love of God, Isabel, wind it up. Enough already.<br><br>"And did you know that in a few years Isabel is going to inherit land in Scotland? It's called Glen MacKenna," she rushed on. "She invited the strangest little man to the wedding and the reception. I just met him, and he has all the information he&#x2019;s collected in boxes in Texas. He's a professor, you see, and he's done quite a lot of research on a feud that he says has existed for centuries between the Buchanans and the MacKennas. According to the professor, Dylan and Kate should never have gotten married. There's a legend about a treasure too. It's fascinating, really it is."<br><br>She finally had to pause to take a breath or she&#x2019;d pass out.<br><br>He stopped dancing for a few seconds and then asked, "Do I make you nervous?"<br><br>Duh.<br><br>"When you stare at me you do. I'd appreciate it if you would go back to being rude and stare over my head when you speak to me. That is why you do it, isn't it? To be rude?"<br><br>His face lit up. "And to irritate you."<br><br>"It works. You do irritate me."<br><br>Would Isabel never finish the song? She was taking forever. Jordan smiled nonchalantly at the couples gliding by as she wished for the dance to end. It would be rude to just walk away, wouldn't it? <br><br>Noah nudged her chin up with his index finger and looked squarely at her. "May I make a suggestion?" he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure," she said. "Suggest away."<br><br>"You ought to think about getting into the game."<br><br>She sighed. "What game would that be?"<br><br>"Life."<br><br>Apparently he wasn&#x2019;t through giving her suggestions on ways to improve her dull existence.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know the difference between you and me?" he asked.<br><br>"I can think of more than a thousand differences."<br><br>"I eat the dessert."<br><br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Only that life&#x2019;s too short. Sometimes you just have to eat dessert first.&#x201d;<br><br>She knew where this was going. &#x201c;I get it. I watch life while you live it. I know you think I should do something spontaneous instead of always planning everything out, but for your information, I&#x2019;m already doing something spontaneous."<br><br>"Yeah?" he asked, the challenge was there in his voice. "What's that?"<br><br>"Spontaneous," she stalled.<br><br>"And what would that be?"<br><br>She knew he didn't believe her. Come hell or high water, she was determined to do something spontaneous, even if it killed her. The satisfaction of wiping that arrogant know-it-all grin off his face would be worth any sacrifice, even if it wasn't logical.<br><br>"I'm going to Texas," she said, enforcing her decision with a nod.<br><br>"What for?" he asked.<br><br>"Why am I going to Texas?" She didn't have the faintest idea at first, but fortunately she was a quick thinker. Before he could say another word, she answered her own question.<br><br>"I'm going on a treasure hunt."</p><h2>The Eucharist: Mystery of Presence, Sacrifice, and Communion</h2><p><p><i>The Eucharist: Mystery of Presence, Sacrifice, and Communion</i> explores the three ends of the Sacrament of Sacraments: God's true presence, His redemptive sacrifice, and spiritual nourishment through communion with Him. In this follow-up to his groundbreaking work, <i>Faith Comes From What Is Heard</i>, Lawrence Feingold constructs a biblical vision of the Eucharist from its prefigurement in the Old Testament to its fulfillment in the New and presents the Eucharistic theology of the Church Fathers, St. Thomas Aquinas, and magisterial teaching from centuries past through today. <i>The Eucharist</i> is a masterful text, both challenging and spiritually rich, that comprehensively examines the unspeakable mystery that is the Eucharist.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Lawrence Feingold is Associate Professor of Theology and Philosophy at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary in St. Louis. In 1999 he earned a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome. He is the author of <i>Faith Comes From What is Heard: An Introduction to Fundamental Theology, The Natural Desire to See God according to St. Thomas Aquinas and His Interpreters</i>, and a three-volume series entitled <i>The Mystery of Israel and the Church.</i></p><p>"In addition to being a Catholic theologian of the highest rank, Professor Lawrence Feingold is also one of the very finest teachers in the Catholic academy today. Like his intellectual and spiritual master, St. Thomas Aquinas, Feingold not only sees deeply into Catholic truth, he also unlocks for his students the wise order by which the faith is most fully intelligible. His book on the Eucharist showcases Professor Feingold at the height of his theological and pedagogical powers. Professors of sacramental theology now have a resource that is sure to enrich their courses and the spiritual lives of their students."<br> Roger W. Nutt, Associate Professor of Theology and Director of the MA Program in Theology, Ave Maria University</p> <p>"A stunning achievement. Lawrence Feingold's up-to-date study of the Eucharist is truly comprehensive, taking the reader from the book of Genesis through the Upper Room and all the way to Pope Francis. The result is a biblical, patristic, medieval, modern, and thoroughly Catholic study of the sacrament that is the 'source and summit of the Christian life.'

Dr. Feingold has written a masterful summary of the Catholic theology of the Eucharist that integrates scriptural and patristic foundations with scholastic and magisterial teachings on Eucharistic presence, the Mass as sacrifice, the participation of the faithful in the sacrifice of the Mass, the fruits of the Eucharist, adoration of the Eucharist, and contemporary canonical-pastoral questions regarding the worthy reception of Holy Communion. Drawing upon St. Thomas Aquinas and other eminent theologians, Dr. Feingold provides a treatment of the Holy Eucharist that is ideal for Catholic university and seminary classes on 'the most august sacrament.'"<br> Robert L.

And they provide to their successors in the United States and the finance ministers and central bank governors of other countries a valuable playbook for reducing the damage from future financial crises. <i>Firefighting</i> provides a candid and powerful account of the choices they and their teams made during the crisis, working under two presidents and with the leaders of Congress.</p><p><b>Ben Bernanke</b>, currently a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, was the chairman of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014. <b>Timothy F.

What game will they play next? The answer is Gypsies. While April plunges in with her usual enthusiasm, Melanie seems to be holding back. But it's Toby who adds a really new wrinkle when he announces that he himself is a bona fide Gypsy. Plus he can get them some of his grandmother's things to use as real Gypsy props for the new game. What could be more thrilling? Then Toby suddenly and mysteriously disappears, and the kids discover that living as real-life Gypsies may not be as much fun as they thought. How will they find Toby and rescue him from the very real problems that are haunting his life?Raised in California, in the country--with no television and few movies to watch--three-time Newbery Honor winner Zilpha Keatley Snyder filled her childhood with animals, games, and books. Among her earliest acquaintances were cows, goats, ducks, chickens, rabbits, dogs, cats, and horses. In fact, her family's animals were her closest friends, and a nearby library was a constant source of magic, adventure, and excitement for her. And when she wasn't reading or playing with animals, Snyder made up games and stories to entertain herself.<br>While Zilpha Keatley Snyder was growing up, interesting stories filled her household. Both of her parents spent a lot of time relating accounts of past events in their lives, so Snyder came by her storytelling instincts early. But unlike her parents, when Zilpha had something to tell, she had, as she says, "an irresistible urge to make it worth telling. And without the rich and rather lengthy past that my parents had to draw on, I was forced to rely on the one commodity of which I had an adequate supply--imagination." Consequently, at the age of eight, Zilpha Keatley Snyder decided to become a writer.<br>As a student, Snyder was very proficient in reading and writing, and experienced few problems in the small country schools she attended until the end of sixth grade. But upon entering the seventh grade in the city of Ventura, she was, as she recalls, "suddenly a terrible misfit." Snyder retreated further into books and daydreams, and admits: "Book were the window from which I looked out of a rather meager and decidedly narrow room, onto a rich and wonderful universe. I loved the look and feel of them, even the smell. . . . Libraries were treasure houses. I always entered them with a slight thrill of disbelief that all their endless riches were mine for the borrowing."<br>Snyder attended Whittier College in Southern California, where she says she "grew physically and socially as well as intellectually." There she also met her future husband, Larry Snyder. While ultimately planning to be a writer, after graduation Snyder decided to teach school temporarily. But she found teaching to be an extremely rewarding experience and taught in the upper elementary grades for a total of nine years, three of them as a master teacher for the University of California at Berkeley. Zilpha and Larry were married in June of 1950, and went on to have three children, Melissa, Douglas, and Ben.<br>In the early sixties, when all of her children were finally in school, Snyder began to think about writing again. "Writing for children hadn't occurred to me when I was younger, but nine years of teaching in the upper elementary grades had given me a deep appreciation of the gifts and graces that are specific to individuals with ten or eleven years of experience as human begins. Remembering a dream I'd had when I was twelve years old, about some strange and wonderful horses, I sat down and began to write."<br><i>Season of Ponies</i>, Zilpha Keatley Snyder's first book, was published in 1964. Her most recent novel, <i>Gib Rides Home, </i>follows an orphan boy who shows strength and courage as he endures harsh treatment during his five years at the orphanage before he finds a family of his own. Gib's story is a tribute to the memory of Snyder's father who grew up in an orphanage in Oklahoma.<br>Zilpha Keatley Snyder's three Newbery Honor books are: The Egypt Game, The Headless Cupid, and The Witches of Worm. Other books for Bantam Doubleday Dell are <i>The Trespassers</i>, an <i>American Bookseller</i> Pick of the List; <i>Cat Running</i>, a <i>School Library Journal</i> Best Book of the Year and winner of the 1995 John and Patricia Beatty Award; and her newest work, <i>The Gypsy Game,</i> companion to <i>The Egypt Game.</i><br>Zilpha Keatley Snyder currently lives in Mill Valley, a small town near San Francisco. In her spare time, she loves reading and traveling, and of course, writing, which besides being her occupation has always been her favorite hobby.</p><h2>The Swiss Family Robinson (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>The Swiss Family Robinson (Great Illustrated Classics) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2008] Wyss, Johann</p><p>"For many days we had been tempest-tossed . . .the raging storm increased in fury on the seventh day all hope was lost." From these dire opening lines, a delightful story of adventure begins. One family will emerge alive from this terrible storm: the Robinson's -- a Swiss pastor, his wife, and four sons, plus two dogs and a shipload of livestock, hens, pigeons and geese! Inspired by Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Cruesoe," this heartwarming tale portrays a family's struggle to create a new life for themselves on a strange and fantastic tropical island. There each boy must learn to control his own nature -- such as Ernest's bookishness and Fritz's hot temper -- as their adventures lead to amazing discoveries, danger, and tantalizing surprises, including a puzzling message tied to an albatross's leg. But it is the authenticity of the boys' behavior, the ingenuity of the family, and the natural wonders of this exotic land that have made <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>, first published in 1812-1813, one of the world's best-loved and most enduring stories of shipwreck and survival.Johann Wyss (1743&#x2013;1818) was a Swiss pastor who is best remembered for his book The Swiss Family Robinson. It is said that he was inspired by Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, but wanted to write a story from which his own children would learn, as the father in the story taught important lessons to his children. The Swiss Family Robinson was first published in 1812 and translated into English two years later. It has since become one of the most popular books of all time. The book was edited by his son, Johann Rudolf Wyss, a scholar who wrote the Swiss national anthem. Another son, Johann Emmanuel Wyss, illustrated the book.</p><h2>Barrel-Aged Stout and Selling Out: Goose Island, Anheuser-Busch, and How Craft Beer Became Big Business</h2><p><b>North American Guild of Beer Writer Award Recipient&nbsp;</b><br><br> Goose Island opened as a family-owned Chicago brewpub in the late 1980s, and it soon became one of the most inventive breweries in the world. In the golden age of light, bland and cheap beers, John Hall and his son Greg brought European flavors to America. With distribution in two dozen states, two brewpubs and status as one of the 20 biggest breweries in the United States, Goose Island became an American success story and was a champion of craft beer. Then, on March 28, 2011, the Halls sold the brewery to Anheuser-Busch InBev, maker of Budweiser, the least craft-like beer imaginable. The sale forced the industry to reckon with craft beer&#x2019;s mainstream appeal and a popularity few envisioned. Josh Noel broke the news of the sale in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and he covered the resulting backlash from Chicagoans and beer fanatics across the country as the discussion escalated into an intellectual craft beer war. Anheuser-Busch has since bought nine other craft breweries, and from among the outcry rises a question that Noel addresses through personal anecdotes from industry leaders: how should a brewery grow?</p><p><b>Josh Noel</b> writes about beer and travel for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>;&nbsp;he has also contributed to <i>This American Life&nbsp;</i>and to the <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;other publications.

Is the enemy winning?</p><p>"Thanks to the theory of evolution," writes best-selling author John MacArthur, "naturalism is now the dominant religion of modern society. Less than a century and a half ago, Charles Darwin popularized the credo for this secular religion. Naturalism has now replaced Christianity as the main religion of the Western world, and evolution has become its principal dogma."</p><p>Many Christians who claim to believe that the Bible is God's revealed truth seem willing to allow modern scientific theories to replace the Genesis account of creation. Such compromises present a conspicuous danger. Bible teacher and pastor, John MacArthur, believes that in Genesis 1-3 we find the foundation of every doctrine that is essential to the Christian faith?the vital underpinnings for everything we believe.</p><p><i>The Battle for the Beginning</i> draws a clear line on today's theological landscape. "Everything in Scripture that teaches about sin and redemption assumes the literal truth of the first three chapters of Genesis. If we wobble to any degree on the truth of this passage," John MacArthur insists, "we undermind the very foundations&nbsp;of our faith."</p></p><p>The battle for a true view of the beginning is not optional. Our faith and the future of our world hang on the truth about creation. Dr. MacArthur insists that when naturalistic and atheistic presuppositions are being aggressively peddled as if they were established scientific fact, Bible-believing Christians "ought to expose such lies for what they are and oppose them vigorously." <p>Do you know what you believe about creation? Could you defend your views to those who deny the Genesis account? In this book find answers to the tough questions. Learn what the Bible says about how our universe began.</p><p>John MacArthur has served as pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, since 1969. His ministry of expository preaching is unparalleled in its breadth and influence. In more than five decades of ministry from the same pulpit, he has preached verse by verse through the entire New Testament and several key sections of the Old Testament.

The language could be compared to the building blocks of music (time signatures, chord progressions, verse) - no matter the instruments, style or time period - these building blocks come into play. Feel and sensation are similar building blocks where game design is concerned. They create the meta-sensation of involvement with a game. <br><br>The understanding of how game designers create feel, and affect feel are only partially understood by most in the field and tends to be overlooked as a method or course of study, yet a game's feel is central to a game's success. This book brings the subject of feel to light by consolidating existing theories into a cohesive book. <br><br>The book covers topics like the role of sound, ancillary indicators, the importance of metaphor, how people perceive things, and a brief history of feel in games.<br><br>The associated web site contains a playset with ready-made tools to design feel in games, six key components to creating virtual sensation. There's a play palette too, so the desiger can first experience the importance of that component by altering variables and feeling the results. The playset allows the reader to experience each of the sensations described in the book, and then allows them to apply them to their own projects. Creating game feel without having to program, essentially. The final version of the playset will have enough flexibility that the reader will be able to use it as a companion to the exercises in the book, working through each one to create the feel described. <br><br><br></p><p>The following game design luminaries have promised quotes: <br>Jonathan Blow, Company: Number-None, Game: Braid <br>Matthew Wegner, Development Director, Flashbang Studios, LLC, Games: Sealab 2021 Sweet Mayhem <br>Aubrey Hesselgren, Game Designer, Amorphous, Games: Hoop World, Unannounced XBLA game <br>Derek Yu, Artist, Game Designer, Bit Blot, Games: Aquaria, I'm O.K. <br>Alec Holowka, Programmer, Game Designer, Bit Blot, Games: Aquaria <br>Katherine Isbister, Associate Professor, Rensselaer Polytech (RPI), Morgan Kaufmann game author.</p><h2>The Mediation Process: Practical Strategies for Resolving Conflict</h2><p><b>The <i>Fourth Edition</i> of a seminal work in the field of mediation and conflict resolution</b> <p>For almost thirty years, conflict resolution practitioners, faculty, and students have depended on <i>The Mediation Process</i> as the all-inclusive guide to the discipline.

Yet by God&#x2019;s power the unchanging essence of marriage and the family remains proof, as Bavinck notes, that God&#x2019;s &#x201c;purpose with the human race has not yet been achieved.&#x201d; Neither a ten-step guide nor a one-sided approach, this book embodies a Christian theology of marriage and the family. Accessible, thoroughly biblical, and astonishingly relevant, it offers a mature and concise handling of the origins of marriage and family life and the effects of sin on these institutions, an appraisal of historic Christian approaches, and an attempt to apply that theology. Aptly reminding Christians that &#x201c;the moral health of society depends on the health of family life,&#x201d; Bavinck issues an evergreen challenge to God&#x2019;s people: &#x201c;Christians may not permit their conduct to be determined by the spirit of the age, but must focus on the requirement of God&#x2019;s commandment.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book</b><br><br><b>One of the Best Books of the Year</b><br><b><i>The Washington Post</i> � <i>The Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> � <i>Rocky Mountain News</i></b><br><br>In this brilliant, lively, and eye-opening investigation, Tom Vanderbilt examines the perceptual limits and cognitive underpinnings that make us worse drivers than we think we are. He demonstrates why plans to protect pedestrians from cars often lead to more accidents. He uncovers who is more likely to honk at whom, and why. He explains why traffic jams form, outlines the unintended consequences of our quest for safety, and even identifies the most common mistake drivers make in parking lots.<i> </i><b>Traffic </b>is about more than driving: it's about human nature. It will change the way we see ourselves and the world around us, and it may even make us better drivers.</p><p><br> <b>Amazon Best of the Month, July 2008</b>: How could no one have written this book before? These days we spend almost as much time driving as we do eating (in fact, we do a lot of our eating <i>while</i> driving), but I can't remember the last time I saw a book on all the time we spend stuck in our cars. It's a topic of nearly universal interest, though: everybody has a strategy for beating the traffic. Tom Vanderbilt's <i>Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</i> has plenty of advice for those shortcut schemers (Vanderbilt may well convince you to become, as he has, a dreaded "Late Merger"), but more than that it's the sort of wide-ranging contrarian compendium that makes a familiar subject new. I'm not the first or last to call <i>Traffic</i> the <i>Freakonomics</i> of cars, but it's true that it fits right in with the school of smart and popular recent books by Leavitt, Gladwell, Surowiecki, Ariely, and others that use the latest in economic, sociological, psychological, and in this case civil engineering research to make us rethink a topic we live with every day. Want to know how much city traffic is just people looking for parking? (It's a lot.) Or why street signs don't work (but congestion pricing does), why new cars crash more than old cars, and why Saturdays now have the worst traffic of the week? Read <i>Traffic</i>, or better yet, listen to the audio book on your endless commute. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <br> <br> <b>Questions for Tom Vanderbilt, author of <i>Traffic</i></b><br> <br> <b>Q: Was this book really born on a New Jersey highway?</b><br> A: Yes, though it could have been any highway in the world, where countless drivers, driving on a crowded road that is about to lose a lane, have had to make a simple decision: When to merge. For my entire driving life, I had always merged "early," thinking it was the polite and efficient thing to do. I viewed those who kept driving to the merge point, to the front of line, as selfish jerks who were making life miserable for the rest of us. I began to wonder: Were they really making things worse? Was I making things worse? Could merging be made easier? Why were there late mergers and early mergers, and why did people get so worked up about the whole thing? In that everyday moment I seemed to sense a vast, largely under-explored wilderness before me: Traffic. <br> <br> <b>Q: Is it true that the most common cause of stress on the highway is merging? Why of the myriad things to cause stress on the road is this at the top?</b><br> A: Merging is the most stressful single activity we face in everyday driving, according to a survey by the Texas Transportation Institute. People who have done studies at highway construction work zones have also told me of extraordinarily bad behavior, triggered by this simple act of trying to get two lanes of traffic into one. Sometimes, it&#x2019;s simply the difficult mechanics of driving &#x2014; trying to enter a stream of traffic flowing at a higher speed than you are, for example. Drivers, to quote a physicist who was actually talking about grains, are objects "who do not easily interact." But I also think there&#x2019;s something about the forward flow of traffic that makes us register progress only by our own unimpeded movement; as in life, we seem to register losses more powerfully than gains, and registering these losses boosts stress. <br> <br> <b>Q: You say that, "For most of us who are not brain surgeons, driving is probably the most complex everyday thing we do in our lives." How so?</b><br> A: Researchers have estimated there are anywhere from 1500 to 2500 discrete skills and activities we undertake while driving. Even the simplest thing &#x2014; shifting gears &#x2014; is a decision-making process consuming what is called "cognitive workload." We&#x2019;re operating heavy machinery at speeds beyond our long evolutionary history, absorbing (and discarding) huge amounts of information, and having to make snap decisions &#x2014; often based on limited situational awareness, guesses about what others are going to do, or a hazy knowledge of the actual traffic law. It took years of research, for example, by some of the country&#x2019;s top robotics researchers, to create expensive, sophisticated self-driving "autonomous vehicles" that are basically mediocre beginning drivers that you&#x2019;d never want to let loose in everyday traffic. When we forget that driving isn&#x2019;t necessarily as easy as it seems to be, we get into trouble. <br> <br> <b>Q: Drivers polled in America say the roads are getting less civil with each passing year. &#x2018;Road Rage&#x2019; is an ever more common term. What is to blame? Hummers? Or are we just getting ruder?</b><br> A: Every year, more people are driving more miles, so one reason for the sense that the roads are getting less civil is simply that there are many more chances for you to have an encounter with an aggressive or rude driver. It&#x2019;s tough to put numbers on it, but I happen to feel, like many people, that behavior has gotten qualitatively worse &#x2014; surveys have suggested, for example, that using the turn signal is an increasingly optional activity. Leaving aside the issue that not signaling is illegal (because, let&#x2019;s face it, we&#x2019;re never going to be able ticket everyone who doesn&#x2019;t do it, nor do we probably want to), it&#x2019;s one of those small things, requiring little effort from the driver, that makes traffic flow more smoothly &#x2014; I myself have honked countless times at "idiots" slowing for no apparent reason, only to seem them eventually make a turn. It&#x2019;s antisocial behavior, the equivalent of having the door held open for you and saying nothing in return. So why don&#x2019;t people signal? My immediate theory is that they&#x2019;re using a cell phone and are distracted or physically incapable of signaling. But a deeper reason, I suspect, may be seen in the surveys of psychologists who measure narcissism in American culture. They find, as time goes on, more people are willing to say things like "If I ruled the world, it would be a better place." Traffic is filled with people who think that roads belong only to them &#x2014; it&#x2019;s "MySpace" &#x2014; that being inside the car absolves them from any obligation to anyone else. People are glad to tell you that their child is a middle school honor student &#x2014; as if anyone cared! &#x2014; but they deem it less important to tell you what they&#x2019;re going to do in traffic. <br> <br> <b>Q: So much of what you uncover about life on the road seems counterintuitive. Like the fact that drivers drive closer to oncoming cars when there is a center line divider then when there is not; that most accidents happen close to home in familiar, not foreign, surroundings; that dangerous roads can be safer; safer cars can be more dangerous; that suburbs are often riskier than the inner city; the roundabout safer than the intersection. When it comes to traffic why are things so different from how we instinctively perceive them?</b><br> A: I think part of the reason is it&#x2019;s easy for us to confuse what feels dangerous or safe in the moment and what might be, in a larger sense, safe or dangerous. We have a windshield&#x2019;s eye view of driving that sometimes blinds us to larger realities or skews our perception. Roundabouts feel dangerous because of all the work one has to do, like looking for an opening, jockeying for positioning. But it&#x2019;s precisely because we have to do all that, and because of the way roundabouts are designed, that we have to slow down. By contrast, it feels quite "safe" to sail through a big intersection where the lights are telling you that you have the right to speed through. We can, in essence, put our brain on hold. But those same intersections contain so many more chances for what engineers call "conflict," and at much higher speeds, than roundabouts. So when what seems quite safe suddenly turns quite dangerous &#x2014; will we be as well prepared? Similarly, we might be reassured that that yellow or white dividing line on a road is telling us where we should be, but how does that knowledge then change our behavior, to the point where may actually be driving closer &#x2014; and faster &#x2014; to the stream of oncoming traffic? Accidents are more likely to occur closer to home. Mostly this is because we do most driving closer to home, but studies do show that we pay less attention to signs and signals on local roads, because we "know" them, yet this knowledge actually give us a false sense of security. <br> <br> <b>Q: What were some of the things that most surprised you in researching this book?</b><br> A: Things that surprised me the most were those that challenged my own long-held beliefs as a driver, like that "late mergers" simply must be somehow worse for the traffic flow at work-zones, that roundabouts were dangerous places, that warning signs were there because they must be working, that car drivers were more of a contributing factor in truck-car crashes than truck drivers. It was also quite a revelation to learn about the many ways our eyes and our minds deceive us while driving, the ways we "look but don&#x2019;t see," the way we sometimes believe, to slightly change up the warning our mirrors gives us, that objects are further away than they actually are. Then there were the things I had never really thought about, but were surprising nonetheless &#x2014; that drivers seem to pass closer to cyclists when those cyclists are wearing helmets, how the ways in which drivers honk at each other contain subtle indications of status and demographics, how much traffic on the streets is simply people looking for parking. I was also unpleasantly surprised to learn how far the U.S. had slipped in terms of traffic safety in the world, where it was once the leader. <br> <br> <b>Q: You write, "The truth is the road itself tells us far more than signs do." So do traffic signs work?</b><br> A: We&#x2019;ve probably all had the somewhat absurd moment of driving in the country, past a big red barn, the pungent smell of cow manure on the breeze, and then seeing a yellow traffic sign with a cow on it. Does anyone need that sign to remind them that cows may be nearby? To quote Hans Monderman, the legendary Dutch traffic engineer who was opposed to excessive signing, "if you treat people like idiots, they&#x2019;ll act like idiots." Then again, perhaps someone did come blazing along and hit a crossing cow or a tractor, and in response engineers may have been forced to put up a sign. The question is: Would that person have done that regardless of the sign? The bulk of evidence is that people don&#x2019;t change their behavior in the presence of such signs. Children playing, School zone? People speed through those warnings, faster than they even thought, if you query them later. To take another example, the majority of people killed at railroad crossings in the U.S. are killed at crossings where the gates are down. If this is insufficient warning that they should not cross the tracks then is a sign warning that a train might be coming really going to change behavior? At what point do people need to rely on their own judgment? We as humans seem to act on the message that traffic signs give us in complex ways &#x2014; studies have shown, for example, that people drive faster around curved roads that are marked with signs telling them the road is curved. We tend to behave more cautiously in the face of uncertainty. <br> <br> <b>Q: What is "psychological traffic calming"?</b><br> A: Traditional "traffic calming" relies on putting big, visually obvious obstructions in the road, like speed bumps, or the wider, flatter speed humps. Unfortunately, since the bulk of drivers, like tantrum-throwing toddlers, really don&#x2019;t like to be calmed, a lot of these don&#x2019;t work as well as hoped, or produce negative, unintended consequences, like the fact that people will raise their speed between the bumps to make up for the time lost slowing to traverse the bump. So-called "psychological traffic calming" basically tries to calm traffic without drivers even realizing they&#x2019;re being calmed. It does so through things like reducing the width of roads, using pavements of different colors or textures, even removing center-line dividers, which studies have shown is one way to get drivers to slow down. Even creating visual interest along the side of the road, a no-no in traditional traffic engineering because it&#x2019;s a "distraction," can be used to calm traffic &#x2014; when something&#x2019;s worth seeing, after all, people slow down. The most radical approach is removing any signage at all, and forcing drivers to rely on their own wits, as well as the dynamics of human interaction, as has been seen in some interesting experiments in the Netherlands. <br> <br> <b>Q: You cite 20 miles per hour as the speed at which eye contact becomes impossible. How central to understanding traffic, and human communication generally, is this statistic?</b><br> A: Eye contact is a fundamental human signal &#x2014; all kinds of studies have shown, for example, how people are more likely to cooperate with one another when they can make eye contact. When we don&#x2019;t have it, when we become anonymous, we not only lose some of that impulse towards cooperation, we seem to become susceptible to all kinds of behavior we might not otherwise engage in. In most driving situations, of course, we lose eye contact, and have to make do with our rather limited vocabulary of traffic signals. At much slower speeds, however, like those seen in the experimental roundabouts in the Netherlands were most signage has been stripped away, it is fascinating to see how intricately all the traffic can interweave &#x2014; exactly because some of those human signals have been restored. <br> <br> <b>Q: We&#x2019;ve all had the experience of the annoying passenger who can&#x2019;t stop critiquing our driving when we know are driving just perfectly. Then again, we&#x2019;ve all been the back seat driver to people who think they are driving perfectly when we know for sure they are about to kill us. What accounts for the way drivers vs. passengers experience the same ride?</b><br> A: First of all, I should stress that passengers, even annoying back-seat drivers, are good for us: Statistics show that people are less likely to crash when they are accompanied in the car (except, interestingly, teen drivers). But there&#x2019;s several interesting things going on between drivers and passengers. For one, driving as an activity often lacks regular feedback &#x2014; we&#x2019;re often not aware in the moment of how close to a crash we almost came, or our own culpability in that. Secondly, drivers tend to self-enhance. They all tend to think they are better than average, or at least average drivers &#x2014; it&#x2019;s been called the "Lake Woebegone Effect." Passengers are not caught up in this dynamic &#x2014; there&#x2019;s no such thing as a "better than average" passenger &#x2014; nor do they feel themselves joined to the mechanics of the car, the way a driver does. Brain scans of people doing simulated driving have even revealed different results from people acting as simulated passengers. In the end, a back-seat driver, like it or not, is providing feedback, the same way someone can view footage of their golf swing to learn what they couldn&#x2019;t see in the moment. <br> <br> <b>Q: You talk about numerous experiments going on around the world to study traffic, what are some of the ones that you found most interesting?</b><br> A: One of the most fascinating things that is happening, thanks to technology like TiVo style cameras and feedback sensors, is that researchers are becoming increasingly able to study how drivers really behave on the road, learning curious details about, for example, how much time drivers spend looking in certain places &#x2014; forward at the road, in the rear-view mirrors, away from traffic, at the radio, etc. With companies like DriveCam, this information is actually being used to coach drivers &#x2014; beginners but also experienced drivers &#x2014; based on the crashes they narrowly avoided.

But what about the dark side of introspection? Do you ever feel weighed down and exhausted by your own self-analysis? Perhaps you made a mistake, said a careless word, or even messed up big time. Your self-examination spirals into a full-blown cross-examination. You keep revisiting what happened. Your mind circles around the event, fruitlessly trying to somehow make the outcome different so you don't feel the embarrassment, shame, and regret. </p><p>The modern self-esteem movement has left us empty and self-focused. We exhaust our healthy introspection and pervert it into constant self-evaluation, wrong views of ourselves, self-accusation, and false guilt. Introspection was never meant to bear such weight. </p><p><em>Think Again</em> offers real relief from the burden of introspection that so many of us carry each day. Pastor Jared Mellinger, who tends to overdose on self-analysis himself, shows us how the hope of the gospel can rescue us from the bad fruit of unsound introspection. Mellinger's short, story-filled chapters help readers identify and turn away from unhealthy introspection. There is an outward-focused God who delights to rescue an inward-focused people and lead them into a better way to live. When we truly understand it, we ll see that the gospel actually sets us free from thinking about ourselves too much. We can seek after and pray for the peace and joy the sanity that comes from thinking about ourselves less often. </p><p><em>Think Again</em> includes practical instructions for self-examination, fighting false guilt, breaking free from hyper-introspection, and more. Ultimately, Think Again demonstrates that the solution to thinking too much about ourselves is to look to Jesus Christ, and it gives readers the tools to begin to turn from the mirror.</p></p><p>Jared Mellinger is the senior pastor at Covenant Fellowship Church in Glen Mills, PA, where he lives in with his wife Meghan and their six children."Martin Luther believed man's problem is that he is incurvatus in se-turned in on himself. In Think Again Jared Mellinger tackles one devastating effect of this in an astute, pastorally sensitive, and deeply searching but healing way. Here is analysis, diagnosis and remedy all in one. Plus it's readable. The best books work on us while we are reading them and help effect the very transformation they describe. This is one of them."<br>Sinclair Ferguson, Author of The Christian Life and Devoted to God <p>"Think Again is a great little book. It navigates us through the maze of introspection in a biblical, practical, straight-forward manner. Read it for yourself; give it to a friend-for it shows how Christ can set us free from our own thoughts. I believe that for many people this will be a truly liberating book."<br>Tim Chester, Faculty member of Crosslands; author of over thirty books, including You Can Change</p> <p>"Think Again is a surprisingly delightful book. Surprising in that such a short book can accomplish such depth in searching the reader's heart, delightful in its flow, humor and encouragement.

With great wisdom and the tender care of a pastor, Jared shepherds the reader to best see themselves only in view of Christ."<br>Brian Davis, Pastor of Risen Christ Fellowship, Philadelphia, PA</p> <p>"Jared Mellinger understands that unless we learn how to take every thought captive, we can easily become captive ourselves to thoughts that control our emotions and ultimately, our lives. Think Again will help you find freedom as you learn how to guard your heart as you renew your mind."<br>Bob Lepine, Cohost of FamilyLife Today</p> <p>"You're introspective. Everyone is. But if you're honest, you're more than introspective; you're self-absorbed. You think about yourself a ridiculous amount. Everyone does. But there is escape from suffocating introspection and healing of the cataract of selfishness in your soul-eye. Let Jared Mellinger help you. He humbly and humorously speaks from experience. Discover, as Chesterton once said, &#x2018;how much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it.'"<br>Jon Bloom, Cofounder of Desiring God; author of Not By Sight and other books</p> <p>"Jared Mellinger's book, Think Again, is simplyone of the clearest, biblically faithful, most winsome, solidly helpful, and briefest(!) books you'll ever read on the topic of introspection. Jared skillfully avoids the extremes of never thinking about ourselves and always thinking about ourselves, and points us to the only cure for our self-absorbed souls: being overwhelmed by the matchless beauty and glory of Christ. I can't wait to give this to others."<br>Bob Kauflin, Director of Sovereign Grace Music; elder at Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville; author of Worship Matters and True Worshipers</p> <p>"In an age of narcissism, entitlement, and attention-seeking egos in search of self-esteem, we need more voices pointing us to a vision and story greater than self. For only when we lose ourselves do we find our truest, healthiest, and most life-giving selves in Jesus. Jared has written an excellent book to help us along in this journey."<br>Scott Sauls, Senior pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, TN; author of Jesus Outside the Lines and Befriend</p> <p>A self-absorbed culture keeps telling us that the solution to our problems is somewhere inside of us. So we keep looking. I talk about me, then I ask you to talk about me. More mirrors, more lanterns, more navel-gazing. Trouble is, these things aren't leading us to freedom and rest, but to self-love or self-hatred. Jared offers us a way out of the vortex of introspection. Without obliterating the self, Think Again takes the reader up into worship and gratitude and out into the joy of service.<br>Matt Mason, Senior Pastor of The Church at Brook Hills, Birmingham, AL</p> <p>"Introspection is a plague that cripples our souls and clouds the love of our Savior. Think Again addresses our daily temptation to focus our attention inward. Jared not only helps us discern this subtle tendency but also provides the liberating alternative in the Gospel. This book delivers grace."<br>C. J. Mahaney, Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville</p> <p>"In this rich and thoughtful book, Jared Mellinger shows us that the solution to self-focus is God-intoxication. Think Again lifts the head of the introspective, the one lost in labyrinths of the self, and unveils the sure and certain hope of God. This God has not stayed silent; he has not kept to himself; he has not failed to provide a savior for sinners like us."<br>Owen Strachan, Author of Risky Gospel and The Colson Way; theology professor, Midwestern Seminary</p></p><h2>Fifteen</h2><p><p>It seems too good to be true.

Something that until recently I could not have imagined or predicted. Something that is changing the basic fabric of people's lives and is impacting how all of us relate to the things we have and the things we own. Something that affects us all. We are, as a nation, overwhelmed with too much stuff. </p><p> Did the title of this book catch your eye? Maybe you are at a stage in your life where something in your life is too much -- your career, your relationship, or "just everything" is suddenly overwhelming. If so, you are part of a harsh awakening in this country, and across much of the developed world, as we come to realize that happiness and success might not be measured by more material things. That having more possessions may be more suffocating than liberating. That a larger house, better car, and more "stuff" come with no guarantee of greater happiness. That for many of us, the stuff we own ends up owning us. Suddenly you look around at the life you've built and all you've acquired and realize that it's all too much! </p><p> I have an unusual job. I help people dig themselves out from under the overwhelming crush of their own possessions. I'm not talking about a messy closet or one too many boxes of holiday decorations in the garage. I work with people who have filled their homes, their offices, sometimes their cars, and always their lives with too much stuff. These are people who have lost the ability to deal reasonably and rationally with what they own. They fill every corner of their homes with clothes, papers, their kids' school projects, wrapping paper, collectibles, scrapbooking materials, garden tools, kitchen products, sporting gear, antiques, dolls, toys, books, car parts, and every imaginable (and unimaginable!) item you could list. </p><p> Surprisingly, as I've traveled across the United States helping people declutter and get organized, I have come to see that the problem is one that affects far more families than I could have imagined. Every single person I have met tells me not only about their own clutter problem, but the clutter problems of a family member, or those of a friend. Nobody seems immune. The stories are not dissimilar -- papers and magazines run amok, garages overflow with unopened boxes, kids' toys fill rooms, and closets are so stuffed that it looks like the clothing department of a major retailer is having a fire sale. The epidemic of clutter, the seeming inability to get organized, and the sense that "the stuff" is taking over affects us all. </p><p> We are at the center of an orgy of consumption, and many are now seeing that this need to own so much comes with a heavy price: Kids so overstimulated by the sheer volume of stuff in their home that they lose the ability to concentrate and focus. Financial strain caused by misplaced bills or overpurchasing. Constant fighting because neither partner is prepared to let go of their possessions. The embarrassment of living in a house that long ago became more of a storage facility than a home. </p><p> This clutter doesn't just come in the form of the physical items that crowd our homes. We are bombarded every day with dire predictions of disaster and face many uncertainties -- some real and many manufactured. Think about the perils that we've been warned about in the last decade alone -- killer bees, Y2K, SARS, anthrax, mad cow disease, avian flu, flesh-eating bacteria . . . the list goes on and on. We are also faced daily with reports of war, an unstable economy, and global terrorism coming very close to home. Surprisingly, this endless barrage (its own kind of clutter) inspires many of the families with whom I work to finally take control of their own clutter. In an unpredictable, dangerous world that is out of their control, they look to their homes for stability -- to get some degree of organization back into their closets, their garages, their home offices, their lives. This quest for organization is a deeply personal response to the feeling that the rest of the world is out of control. </p><p> Among the clutter, the frustration, and the yearning for organization, I constantly hear the same refrain: It is all overwhelming. The stuff has taken on a life of its own and families have no idea where to even begin. They are paralyzed by their own stuff. Often the people I work with lament, "It's all too much -- help me!" </p><p> If you find yourself at the point of being overwhelmed by your possessions, you have a clear choice: Decide here and now that you no longer want your stuff to overrun your life. Work with me to get balance and harmony back into your family and relationships. It can be done and I know how. None of this frightens me or overwhelms me because I have seen it all. I have never walked away from a cluttered home because it was too much. However, I <i>have</i> walked away from those who value their stuff over their relationships, their things over their dreams, or their possessions over their vision for the life they really want. </p><p> If you are one of those for whom it's suddenly all too much and want to let go, come on an exciting journey with me to reclaim your life. Living a richer, fuller, more exciting, and rewarding life is not that far away. Trust me, I've led many there already and you can be next. I promise you, if you do this, there is nothing you can't do! </p><p> </p><p> <b>IT'S ALL TOO MUCH</b> </p><p> Let me tell you about one of my average workdays. One sunny June day, Jared and Lisa invited me into their modest house in the suburbs of Maryland. From the tree-lined street their home looked welcoming. The grass was neatly trimmed, the garden in full bloom. A gray sedan was parked in the driveway. I rang the doorbell. </p><p> The door opened to an appalling site. The floor was invisible. Every flat surface was stacked high with papers. The walls were lined with wall-to-wall file boxes, some stacked on shelves or tables. Many of the piles reached the top of my head and I'm not a short man. The living room was so crowded that the kitchen had become their little boy Cooper's playroom. A toy train track ran through the legs of the kitchen table, its cars long ago scattered, tripped on, and lost. The family was overrun with what appeared to be scrapbooking materials: glue, notebooks, piles of photos, trim, and all sorts of craft material. In short, the house was a disaster. I glanced at Jared and Lisa. To all appearances they are clean, hardworking, upstanding citizens, no different from you or me. Jared manages a successful airport shuttle business. After taking a few years off to have their first child, Lisa has just gotten her real-estate license. Cooper was three years old and delighted in showing me his firm handshake. A great family. And a successful one, in spite of the clutter. But underneath their sunny exterior was tension. They wanted more from their lives and believed the chaos of their home was taking away from their happiness. There was an obvious question that needed an answer: Why was their house completely out of control? </p><p> I asked Lisa what it was like living in this chaos. She said, "It's suffocating. I feel like I can't breathe when I look in the office." Lisa felt buried by her own stuff. She went on, "Something has to change. I don't want to live like this. But I have no idea where to begin." </p><p> And then I heard the one refrain that sums it all up, the words of despair that I hear over and over again from everyone I work with: "It's all too much." </p><p> That is why I decided to call this book <i>It's All Too Much</i>. It's a response to the hopelessness of that refrain. It's about what to do when you reach the point where you don't know where to start. When you're faced with so much mess that you throw up your hands in despair and give up. When you just want to move into a hotel, or throw it all out, or shove it in the garage, like when you were a kid and stuffed all your dirty clothes under the bed. Amazingly, I have dealt with people who have purchased a second home rather than face the mammoth task of decluttering the home they have lived in for many years! Well, there's no place to hide your mess when you're an adult and, eventually, you have to come home, so you might as well start dealing with the problem now. <i>It's All Too Much</i> is the solution. </p><p> </p><p> <b>It's just stuff</b> </p><p> I asked Jared if he felt as overwhelmed as Lisa. He shrugged. "I know our house doesn't belong in <i>Martha Stewart</i>, but we're busy. It's just stuff. I don't see what the big deal is." I walked over to their bookshelf and started scanning the titles. There were diet books. Exercise books. Self-esteem books. Career motivation books. Parenting books. Finance books. Marriage books. Books on how to live better, happier, richer, fuller lives. It was a complete library of self-help books for every issue a family might have. It was time for me to tell him what I tell all of my clients: the truth. It was time to hold a mirror up to their life and their clutter so that they could see what was happening. I sat him and Lisa down and said, "You think the state of this house is no big deal, but look at all these problems you're trying to solve." I gestured toward the stack of self-help books. "Your home is the physical and emotional base for your family. You want to change? To get motivated? Improve your self-image? Lose weight? Start by taking a look at your home. </p><p> "You want a life built on a solid foundation, but you can't even see the floor beneath you. You want to lose weight, but your kitchen is overwhelmed with appliances you never use. You want to build your career, but your office literally makes you feel ill. You want change? This is where it starts: your home. Where you live, breathe, rest, love, and create. Forget the self-help books. Get rid of the clutter. Get organized. If you do, I promise that every aspect of your life will change in ways that you never imagined possible." </p><p> Jared and Lisa were like so many couples that I deal with -- they had lost sight of the fact that who you are and what you have are intimately linked. The things you buy, the items you va...</p></p><h2>The Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook: Artisanal Baking from Around the World</h2><p><p><b>Bake authentic multiethnic breads from the New York City bakery with a mission, with <i>The Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook</i>, <b>Yahoo Food's Cookbook of the Year. </b></b></p><p>At first glance Hot Bread Kitchen may look like many other bakeries.

We recorded them and called the song, 'Did Everyone Pay Their Dues?' But we weren&#x2019;t that crazy about the results, and the lyrics underwent several rewrites once we saw what was going on in the streets in London and Paris in 1968. While we were in the studio, Mick had been at a huge demonstration against the Vietnam War in London&#x2019;s Grosvenor Square in March. And we were both in Paris in May during the violent protests by students demanding reforms. The French cops were pretty nasty about it.<br>As we traveled around, Mick and I would look at each other and realize something big was happening in two major capitals of the world and that our generation was bursting at the seams. Mick knew that 'Dues' needed a lyric overhaul that better matched what was going on. I came up with the line 'What can a poor boy do' and threw it out to Mick. He completed the thought with '&#x2019;Cept to sing for a rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll band.' He wrote the rest of the new lyrics in the studio. That&#x2019;s often how we worked. One of us would have a piece of a lyric that sounded interesting, then hand it off to the other to get things going."<br><b>Joni Mitchell on "Carey"</b><br>"I had my dulcimer with me from the States.

She lives with her family in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Visit her at LaurenStringer.com.Autumnal bliss is at the heart of this poetic celebration of yellow foliage."Yellow time comes / before white time. / Every time." Watercolor-and-acrylic paintings are as invested in depicting the swirling motion of wind-swept clouds as they are in glorying in the yellow leaves that eventually fall from trees. The flap copy says that Stringer was inspired to write her text after seeing a grove of ash trees turn a brilliant shade of yellow in the fall, and this helps explain the monochromatic vision of autumn, devoid of oranges, reds, and browns, that fills the spreads. From page to page, a multiracial cast of children delights in the autumnal splendor, leaving their houses to cavort in the swirling, falling leaves together. A pet dog and cat, wild squirrels, and an abundance of black crows join in the revelry, their colors peppered across spreads dominated by a washing of golden yellows. The satisfying, bookish conclusion depicts siblings pressing leaves "in thick books to remember... / what a lovely yellow time it was." Lovely, indeed. (Picture book. 3-6)&nbsp; Author: Kirkus Reviews Source: 6/15/16<br><br>Stringer re-creates those last days of autumn when the trees are no longer putting on a fiery show of colors and the leaves are one gusty day away from shuddering to the ground. Short, declarative, yet lyrical sentences set the stage (&#x201c;The squirrels are too busy to notice, and the geese have already gone.&#x201d;). Stringer continues to remind readers of the sounds (&#x201c;Crows love yellow time. They fill still-leafy trees with their voices announcing its coming...&#x201d;) and the smells (&#x201c;wet mud and dry grass with a sprinkle of sugar&#x201d;) of autumn and discusses the changing of the seasons (&#x201c;Yellow time comes before white time. Every time.&#x201d;). When the wind begins, everyone is ready: the trees, the children, the crows, and even the busy squirrels that use the fallen leaves for their lofty nests. The watercolor and acrylic illustrations, subtly reminiscent of Lois Lenski&#x2019;s work, are full of movement and emotion. Stringer&#x2019;s rendering of the autumn landscape and its diverse inhabitants, round faces lifted to the sky, remind readers of a moment in time. VERDICT This gorgeous picture book is a fine addition to seasonal and classroom collections, but it stands alone for its language and deft artwork. A lovely, evocative read-aloud. Author: School Library Journal *STARRED* Source: July 2016<br><br>&#x201c;Look outside! Yellow time is on its way.&#x201d; In exuberant, expressive scenes of swirling yellow ash leaves&nbsp;on the wind, Stringer (When Stravinsky Met Nijinsky, 2013) playfully captures the anticipation of autumn.&nbsp;Children await the once-a-year fall event when the ash tree leaves turn a brilliant yellow. Several&nbsp;harbingers usher in yellow time, like geese leaving, squirrels collecting nuts, and crows that &#x201c;fill still-leafy&nbsp;trees with their voices announcing its coming to everyone.&#x201d; And when that moment arrives, when &#x201c;the sky&nbsp;billows gray with clouds . . . WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!&#x201d; the brilliant yellow ovals swirl in the&nbsp;sky, collect in puddles, and create &#x201c;a symphony of yellow.&#x201d; In paintings rich with movement, echoing the&nbsp;twirling, swooping gusts of color, Stringer depicts a diverse array of children and families enjoying the fall&nbsp;weather, some of whom are making their own yellow paintings of the much loved leaves. Stringer&#x2019;s lyrical&nbsp;text celebrates this fleeting moment in the fall season, and it&#x2019;s beautifully paired with her bold, riotous&nbsp;yellow scenes. A perfect read-aloud for autumn.&nbsp;&#x2014; Anita Lock Author: Booklist Source: 7/1/16<br><br>Stringer (<i>Deer Dancer</i>) offers up a poetic meditation on the transient wonders of autumn&#x2014;aka &#x201c;yellow time&#x201d;&#x2014;finding delight in everything from the smells of the season (&#x201c;Like wet mud and dry grass/ with a sprinkle of sugar&#x201d;) to animals not always considered to be lovely in and of themselves (&#x201c;Black crows fill bare branches/ and raise their voices/ in praise of yellow time&#x201d;). Rendered in acrylic and oil, Stringer&#x2019;s paintings burst with bright swaths of sunflower yellow as trees bend and sway in the wind, giving up their leaves in golden swirls and curls as jacketed children revel in the turbulent weather, making crowns from fallen leaves and saving some to press between book pages as mementos of the season. It&#x2019;s a joyful reminder to make the most of fall when it&#x2019;s here. Up to age 8. Author: Publishers Weekly Source: July 4, 2016<br><br>Evoking the experience of watching leaves falling en masse from ash trees, this&nbsp;picture book celebrates the &#x201c;yellow time&#x201d; when &#x201c;everywhere fills with yellow.&nbsp;A symphony of yellow.&#x201d; The acrylic and watercolor paintings feature swirls and<br> swoops of yellow leaves against black tree trunks and branches. One by one, children&nbsp;(and a dog) head outdoors and join up with one another, full of anticipation.&nbsp;Wearing sweaters and jackets, this diverse group of children together sniffs the&nbsp;air and watches the trees, waiting for the moment when the wind lifts and&#x2014;&nbsp;&#x201c;WHOOSH!&#x201d;&#x2014;the leaves begin to fly. The children are joined by others, who&nbsp;all dance and rejoice in the &#x201c;yellow air.&#x201d; There are no surprise twists here, just a&nbsp;gentle appreciation of the joys of using your senses to notice the changes outdoors&nbsp;as the seasons turn. From the book&#x2019;s cover to the endpapers, yellow makes each&nbsp;picture glow, and curved lines repeat throughout the story to reinforce the beauty&nbsp;of the natural world. Author: The Horn Book Magazine Source: September/October 2016<br><br><i>Yellow Time</i> (Beach Lane /S&amp;S) by Lauren Stringer is a joyfully illustrated, lyrical picture book about the fleeting days before the wind blows the fall leaves into a "symphony of yellow."

The original Bengali collection of 157 poems was published on August 14, 1910. The English Gitanjali or Song Offerings is a collection of 103 English poems of Tagore's own English translations of his Bengali poems first published in November 1912 by the India Society of London. It contained translations of 53 poems from the original Bengali Gitanjali, as well as 50 other poems which were from his drama Achalayatan and eight other books of poetry &#x2014; mainly Gitimalya (17 poems), Naivedya (15 poems) and Kheya (11 poems). The translations were often radical, leaving out or altering large chunks of the poem and in one instance fusing two separate poems (song 95, which unifies songs 89,90 of Naivedya). The translations were undertaken prior to a visit to England in 1912, where the poems were extremely well received. In 1913, Tagore became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, largely for the English Gitanjali.</p><p>William Butler Yeats is generally considered to be Ireland s greatest poet, living or dead, and one of the most important literary figures of the twentieth century.

Rev. J. David Muyskens reminds us that what God seeks is relationship with us, a two-way communication.

Internationally sought after diversity consultant Tiffany Jana offers concrete ways for anyone to work against institutional bias no matter what their position is in an organization.</b><br><br>While it is easy to identify intentionally built systems of oppression like Jim Crow or the paralysis caused by the glass ceiling for women in the workplace, confronting systems that perpetuate subtle, unconscious bias is much harder. Erasing Institutional Bias will help people tackle structural bias regardless of their positional power. Eliminating systemic bias can seem an insurmountable task from the vantage point of an ordinary individual, yet Jana and Mejias empower readers to recognize that each of us has the ability to affect systemic bias through a deliberate, coordinated effort. Institutional bias afflicts all industries --including business, education, health care, government, tech, the arts, nonprofits, and finance and banking. Among the types of institutional bias addressed are hiring bias, gender bias, racial bias, occupational bias, and customer bias. Jana and Mejias focus their attention on bias in the workplace and give readers practices and activities to create organizational trust to challenge these implicit biases. Erasing Institutional Bias will help people recognize that each of us has the power to affect systemic bias. Each of us can evaluate our own current role in perpetuating systemic bias and define our new role in breaking down systemic bias.</p><p><b>Tiffany Jana</b> is the co-founder of TMI Consulting Incorporated, a diversity and inclusion management-consulting firm founded in 2003 and headquartered<br>in Richmond, Virginia.

Her book <i>Copious Hosting: A Theology of Access for People with Disabilities</i>&nbsp;(Continuum, 2002) is considered a seminal text in disability theology. She has served as chief adviser to Dr. Paul Farmer since 2009 and was his chief of staff in his role as United Nations Deputy Special Envoy under President Bill Clinton.&nbsp;</p>In Jennie Block's beautiful book, she illuminates Paul Farmer's life as one driven by a deep anger at deadly injustices and an equally deep conviction that imagination and commitment can make the future healthier, more just and more equal. In these pages, Jennie elucidates how closely linked Paul's faith is to both his anger and his hope. Paul Farmer: Servant to the Poor is a timely and timeless inspirational read about how and why one man has never relinquished his belief that the world can be better, while along the way saving and improving countless lives.Dr. Chelsea Clinton, Vice Chair, Clinton Foundation<br><br>Paul Farmer is one of the most extraordinary people I have ever met. A brilliant doctor and teacher, he tirelessly works for the poorest of the poor, insisting that they deserve the very best care that is available. He not only changes individual lives, but massive systems, proving against overwhelming objections that his methods are not only what Christian compassion demands, but that they bring about effective cures. Jennie Weiss Block will make you fall in love not only with Paul, but with the beloved people to whom he is so passionately committed. This is not a book you can put back on the shelf after reading; it will move you to take the next step in your own commitment to accompany the poorest in our world.Barbara Reid, OP, Professor of New Testament Studies, Catholic Theological Union<br><br>It is rare that readers get to explore the lives of legendary people while they are still with us making this book a precious gift. One of the greatest physician-scholar-activist servants in American history, Paul Farmer is a powerful model of service to the poor. The world has much to learn from his life and witness. For anyone with a heart for the vulnerable, the poor and the underserved, this thoughtful new text about an extraordinary human being is an inspiration and must read.Bryan Stevenson, Director of Equal Justice Initiative and author of <i>Just Mercy</i><br><br>Some say that the devil is in the details, but in the life of Paul Farmer, there's grace in those details! Whether he's living in Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, or Cambridge, channeling the corporal works into weapons of mass salvation, or running with the preferential option for the poor, Paul's life exudes the call that's so tangible in these pages. His friend and spiritual adviser, Jennie Weiss Block captures it all in her compelling account when she asks us, "How do you say no to someone who takes the Gospel so seriously?" Read this beautiful book and see if you too don't find yourself saying, "Yes!"James F.

When guerrilla warfare comes to her area, her life is changed forever. Soldiers eventually discover the small school she attends, beat and murder her teacher, and shoot the other students. Tree climbing saves Gabi from that massacre, and she is away from home when her village is destroyed and nearly all of her family members are murdered. In the course of her flight north to a Mexican refugee camp, she again hides in a tree while soldiers rape and murder the inhabitants of another village. After arriving at the camp, Gabi cares for two elderly women and her one surviving sister and eventually founds a school. Her concern for others helps her recover from the trauma of her experiences. This is a graphic portrayal of the worst of civil war, based on one refugee's story. The author's anger that the U.S. government trained and supported soldiers who committed such atrocities is clear. Details of Guatemalan life are woven throughout the book, but it lacks the sensory descriptions that would allow readers to visualize the setting. Still, the action moves quickly, and Gabi's courage and determination are evident throughout. Readers not put off by the violence should find this an instructive and satisfying survival story.<i>-Kathleen Isaacs, Edmund Burke School, Washington, DC</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This doctrinal position affirms that the Bible is unlike all other books or collections of works in that it is free of error due to having been &#34;given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works&#34; (2 Tim. 3:16, 17). While no other text can claim this same unique authority, the Apostolic Fathers included in this volume (also called the Ante-Nicene Fathers), covers the Early Christian writings from the beginning of Christianity until the promulgation of the Nicene Creed at the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened in Bithynia by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in AD 325. As such, writings contained in this volume of The Researchers Library of Ancient Texts (Volume Two: The Apostolic Fathers: Includes Clement, Anthenagorus, Mathetes, Polycarp, Ignatius, Barnabas, Papias, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus), provides literature that follows the chronology of New Testament texts, which frequently are used or assigned as supplemental works within academic settings to help students and scholars discover or better understand cultural and historical context of the early Christian Church. These ancient texts provide commentators valuable insight into what many ancient Jews and early Christians believed when, &#34;God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets&#34; (Heb. 1:1). The Researchers Library of Ancient Texts is therefore intended to be a supplemental resource for assisting serious researchers and students in the study of the Bible and the early Church age. Contained in this volume: The works of Clement, Anthenagorus, Mathetes, Polycarp, Ignatius, Barnabas, Papias, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus.</p><p><b>Thomas Horn is the adaptor of this work.

I think we might have met before.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m here to tell you a story you&#x2019;re probably not going to believe. But trust me, it&#x2019;s all true. Even the parts that don&#x2019;t seem true. I know because it happened to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> It started when my friend Luna Lopez and I paid a visit to our neighbor Viola Dots. She&#x2019;s the&#x2014;well, let&#x2019;s just say <i>unusual</i> woman who lives next door with her butler, a talking orange pig named Chives. I know what you&#x2019;re thinking. A talking orange pig&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a hard one to believe.<br> &nbsp;<br> But wait, there&#x2019;s more. Viola has this magical, fantastic picture frame in her house. What? You&#x2019;re not sure magical picture frames actually exist? Well, neither was I until I fell into one. But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Viola&#x2019;s frame hangs on the wall in her living room. It looks like one of those fancy golden frames you&#x2019;d see in a museum. And it has a gold clock on the front. When the clock on the frame strikes four, the painting inside opens up and sucks you in.<br> &nbsp;<br> That sounds exciting, but it hasn&#x2019;t worked out too well for Viola Dots. Her son, David, was sucked into a painting fifty years ago and has been lost ever since. The only thing she got in return was Chives, who came flying straight out of some old painting and into her living room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Dots is pretty old now and still misses David like crazy, which is why Luna and I agreed to help her. Every week she paints another painting to put in the frame. And every week, we travel into the frame to look for David.<br> &nbsp;<br> This would be totally fun except for one little detail: If we&#x2019;re not back from inside the painting in exactly one hour, we&#x2019;ll be stuck. That&#x2019;s right. We would have to stay in the world of art forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s a good thing if you&#x2019;re trying to get out of doing your homework. But if you care about ever returning home, it&#x2019;s not so good.<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t blame you if you don&#x2019;t believe me. It&#x2019;s a pretty wild story. So read it for yourself, and then you tell me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Do you really think there is such a thing as a fantastic frame?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Come on, Luna!</i> I thought. <i>Where are you?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Our wooden front porch groaned as I paced back and forth. I checked the time on my Batman watch. Luna had agreed to meet me at exactly fifteen minutes to four, but she was late. We had promised Viola Dots that we&#x2019;d be at her house on time. If we were even one minute late, the magic wasn&#x2019;t going to work.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Luna Lopez, you&#x2019;re going to ruin everything!</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> I heard footsteps coming from inside our duplex. &#x201c;Luna!&#x201d; I called out. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not Luna,&#x201d; an annoying little voice said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Maggie. I came to play with you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Can someone please tell me why little sisters always show up at exactly the wrong time?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t play with you now, squirt,&#x201d; I told Maggie. I tried to herd her back into the house, but the little pest wasn&#x2019;t budging. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Maggie stomped her foot on the porch, which made her sneakers light up. &#x201c;Are you and your new girlfriend going to visit the orange pig with the funny hat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I had to put an end to this conversation right now. The orange pig was a secret&#x2014;only Luna and I could know he actually existed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen up, Maggie,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Number one, Luna is not my girlfriend. She is a girl who happens to be a new friend. And number two, there&#x2019;s no such thing as an orange pig. Didn&#x2019;t they teach you that in preschool?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maggie burst out laughing. I didn&#x2019;t think I had said anything funny.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tiger, you said <i>number two</i>.&#x201d; She giggled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to tell Mommy you&#x2019;re using bathroom words.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Be my guest,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Go tell Mom.&#x201d; I figured at least that would get her back into the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Maggie turned and ran inside, I could hear her chanting, &#x201c;Mommy, Tiger said <i>number two</i>. Tiger said <i>number two</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s four-year-olds for you. Their brains are only half-baked.<br> &nbsp;<br> I checked my watch again. Time was running out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luckily, I heard Luna&#x2019;s footsteps clopping down the stairs. We just moved into a duplex that our families share. Luna lives in the upstairs part. This time, I knew it was her because her shoes clomp when she walks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi, Tiger,&#x201d; she said, like she wasn&#x2019;t even late at all. &#x201c;My grandma made us <i>horchata</i>.&#x201d; She handed me a plastic cup with a frothy white liquid in it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a cinnamon toast milkshake, minus the brain freeze.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time for refreshments,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just taste it. It&#x2019;s my grandpa Arturo&#x2019;s recipe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I took a sip. It was delicious.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your grandpa Arturo knows his stuff,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But we have to hurry. The fantastic frame kicks in at four exactly, and we promised Viola we&#x2019;d be there. She&#x2019;s counting on us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, okay. We can drink while we walk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Luna grabbed a flowered hat from a chair on the porch and popped it on her head. She loves to make crazy-looking hats, and this one definitely was. We raced down our driveway and headed to Viola&#x2019;s house. It was a crumbling old place next door to ours, with peeling blue paint and an overgrown lawn. The house was covered in cobwebs and had a spooky lookout tower on top.<br> &nbsp;<br> We were almost at the front gate when a hand reached out and snatched my <i>horchata</i>. I turned to see a boy with bleached blond hair and braces. Before I realized that he was at least a head taller than me, I blurted out, &#x201c;Hey, you! Give that back!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take it easy, shrimp,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;I just want a sip.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The kid tilted the cup back and drained the whole thing in one awful gulp. Crunching my ice in his mouth, he put the cup on the ground and squashed it under his foot.

With excerpts published in Eisner nominated anthology ISLAND, the full colour volume, drawn and painted by Remy Boydell is an unflinching debut graphic novel. Written by Michelle Perez<br></p><p>AUTOSTRADDLE -- It's a real story that doesn't try to gussy itself up at all. It reads like a Goya painting looks. Perez is telling stories that are so different from other mainstream comics, but will also resonate with so, so many people. You don't need to be trans or a sex worker or depressed to see yourself in this book. Perez is able to capture a shared experience that Millenials have where we just can't seem to swim upriver no matter what or how hard we try. Sometimes when I read books I think "wow, I'd love to live in the world this person has created;" with <i>The Pervert</i>, Perez has written a book where I think "wow, I already do live in the world this person has created." While it's brutal, there's also kindness and love in the book. One of the clients we meet had previously had a relationship with a trans woman and the way he loves her and talks to her warmed my heart. He's never shown as a perfect person, but he's given sympathy, because he's a human being and he's trying. I love these parts of the book. There are also splash pages of art that is simply beautiful. Sometimes the subject matter is something gruesome, like a car crash or deer carcass, but it's still overwhelmingly beautiful.<br><br><br>LIBRARY JOURNAL -- Fictionalizing her own experiences and those of people she's known, writer Perez recounts episodes (some selections previously published in <i>Island</i> anthology) documenting the life of transgender sex worker Felina Love. This isn't champagne-glamorous, high-class stuff but a sometimes bloody obstacle course undertaken at great risk to stay alive, solvent, and sane. For while Seattle offers Felina more permissive ambiance than did her childhood home in Michigan, threats and bullying plus physical and psychological danger lurk everywhere for a person perceived as neither fully male nor female. Her sometimes tormented customers don't have an easy time of it either. Boydell's (<i>Emergency!</i>;<i> Recovery Blogger</i>) anthropomorphic watercolor art provides a manageable distance between readers and characters while lending ironic poignancy. Felina's sexual life, both professional and personal, is depicted candidly, yet in Boydell's hands the effect is dispassionate, not titillating.<br><b>Verdict</b> A challenging, intense, and empathic account of finding oneself despite heavy odds.-Martha Cornog, Philadelphia<br></p><h2>The Autobiography of Jean Luc Picard</h2><p>The Autobiography of Jean-Luc Picard tells the story of one of the most celebrated names in Starfleet history.

It is the world's second biggest economy, the largest manufacturing and trading nation, the consumer of half the world's steel and coal, the biggest source of international tourists, and one of the most influential investors in developing countries from southeast Asia to Africa to Latin America. Multinational companies make billions of dollars in profits in China each year, while traders around the world shudder at every gyration of the country's unruly stock markets. Perhaps paradoxically, its capitalist economy is governed by an authoritarian Communist Party that shows no sign of loosening its grip.<br><br>China is frequently in the news, whether because of trade disputes, the challenges of its Belt and Road initiative for global infrastructure, or its increasing military strength. China's political and technological challenges, created by a country whose political system and values differ dramatically from most of the other major world economies, creates uncertainty and even fear. <br><br><em> China's Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know�</em> is a concise introduction to the most astonishing economic and political story of the last three decades. Arthur Kroeber enhances our understanding of China's changes and their implications. Among the essential questions he answers are: How did China grow so fast for so long? Can it keep growing and still solve its problems of environmental damage, fast-rising debt and rampant corruption? How long can its vibrant economy co-exist with the repressive one-party state? How do China's changes affect the rest of the world?<br><br> This thoroughly revised and updated second edition includes a comprehensive discussion of the origins and development of the US-China strategic rivalry, including Trump's trade war and the race for technological supremacy. It also explores the recent changes in China's political system, reflecting Xi Jinping's emergence as the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It includes insights on changes in China's financial sector, covering the rise and fall of the shadow banking sector, and China's increasing integration with global financial markets. And it covers China's rapid technological development and the rise of its global Internet champions such as Alibaba and Tencent.<br></p><p><br><strong>Arthur R.

In 1879, Pratt made a treacherous journey to the Dakota Territory to recruit Carlisle&#x2019;s first students. <br><br>Years later, three students approached Pratt with the notion of forming a football team.

Fetterman was dun&#x2013;colored and bare, with no cover save for some broken rocks that looked as if they had been thrown down by a short&#x2013;tempered God. There was just one other visible thing on the expanse, the faint double track of the Bozeman Trail, heading off into the immensity that would become Wyoming. The trail sketched westward along a ridge, ragged but decipherable, its ruts worn into the ground by a succession of iron&#x2013;rimmed wheels bearing the weight of American ambition. <br><br>Fetterman and his command of eighty men pushed over the hill and fanned out, barely holding their formation as they chased a handful of Lakota warriors mounted on ponies just ahead, baiting them. The impatient cavalrymen surged forward on their chesty Army horses. Infantrymen grabbed at their stirrups and ran along, trying to keep up. <br><br>The braves drawing the soldiers on had been chosen to lead the attack for their exceptional bravery and fighting skills. One of them was Crazy Horse, not yet famous. Another was a patrician twentysix&#x2013;year&#x2013;old Oglala&#x2013;Lakota named American Horse, a burgeoning leader who was participating in one of the many conflicts with whites that would engage him for the rest of his life. (1)<br><br>American Horse and his fellow decoys beckoned the soldiers with a variety of ruses. They galloped back and forth on ponies, screeching insults and firing occasional shots. They waved blankets at the cavalry horses, hoping to frighten them into bolting. Every now and then, one of the Indians would appear to tire. He would slow and walk his pony, seeming fatigued. This was another feint, perhaps the most tempting of all. The bluecoats hurried after them, down the Bozeman Trail.<br><br>Below, hidden in hollows and gullies on either side of the trail, fully two thousand Oglala, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors awaited the soldiers. They crouched in long grasses, wallows, and swales, holding the lariats of their ponies. Strapped to their bodies were a variety of knives, hatchets, bows, and brilliantly painted shields. They clenched war clubs made of rough triangular rocks bound to heavy wood handles. A few of them had rifles, but mainly they carried bows and arrows, thousands of arrows. (2)<br><br>The isolation and the unfamiliarity of the ground should have made Fetterman pause. The geography of the Dakota Territory alone was forbidding. It was just that&#x2013;territory, not a state or a county, but an indistinct region where the Gilded Age stopped. It was a sunburned and epic American Serengeti, a series of rolling mounds and weather&#x2013;tortured prairie ridges that stretched as far as the eye could see, covered by scorched hay&#x2013;colored grasses, only occasionally interrupted by weird rock outcroppings and misshapen trees. Out here, the world was still large and mysterious; not everything had been discovered, surveyed, charted, explained, and blueprinted.<br><br>It was a magnificent setting, but an austere one, and it provoked deep apprehension in one Army wife. The country was pervaded by &#x201c;an almost overpowering sense of stillness,&#x201d; wrote Frances Grummond, whose husband, George, was a cavalry lieutenant riding with Fetterman, &#x201c;especially at night when conversation could be heard and understood at a long distance.&#x201d; Frances had felt a deep sense of dread since her arrival just a few months earlier. Every cloud seemed to dim the entire landscape; every crack of a rifle in the night seemed to explode right by her bed. &#x201c;Every sound exacted attention.&#x201d; (3)<br><br>The post that Fetterman and his men had ridden out from, Fort Phil Kearny, was hardly a stronghold. Rather, it was an unfinished, frighteningly remote stockade of newly hewn logs, just six months old, and it sat squarely alone in the middle of a six&#x2013;hundred&#x2013;mile tract of Lakota country. It was undermanned and underarmed, with just 640 troops, most of them inexperienced recruits. The nearest reinforcements could be summoned only with a four&#x2013;day, death&#x2013;defying gallop to Fort Laramie.<br><br>Fort Phil Kearny had been built in this forsaken locale to protect the Bozeman Trail, the hazardous new shortcut to the gold fields of Montana, forged by prospector John M. Bozeman in 1864 right through the heart of the Powder River country and Lakota hunting grounds. In just two years, the trail had become an enormously popular route west, with thousands of emigrants trekking along it, homesteaders bound for Oregon, gold seekers, fortune hunters, ranchers, farmers, and trappers. They all clamored for protection, and that spring the U.S. government acceded and sent a force under Colonel Henry B. Carrington to construct a series of garrisons to defend the route, one of them Fort Phil Kearny.<br><br>But in the brief life of the fort, there had already been terrible casualties. Men and livestock were lost almost daily to Lakota raiders, livid over the intrusion of the road and the new fortifications&#x2013;in a sixmonth stretch of 1866 they would kill 154 settlers and soldiers. (4) <br><br>The post commander, Carrington, was increasingly anxious about his vulnerable position. When a woodcutting party was attacked that morning, Carrington issued cautious instructions: Fetterman and his men were to relieve the woodcutters but were not to pursue the Indians beyond the farthest visible ridge, called Lodge Trail.<br><br>Fetterman, however, was not inclined to obey anybody or anything except his own impulse toward bravery. Bristling with whiskers and decorations, he was a hugely confident officer who had been twice brevetted for gallantry in some of the worst fighting of the Civil War. He was the son and nephew of military careerists, with an eye on advancement, and it&#x2019;s likely he chafed at taking orders from Carrington, a painstaking administrative sort who had never been in a major battle. Carrington had been sent west for his efficiency in building the real field 11 forts, not for his fighting abilities. He was fine&#x2013;bearded, sad&#x2013;eyed, and hyperarticulate, and in Fetterman&#x2019;s view weak. &#x201c;We are afflicted with an incompetent commanding officer, viz. Carrington,&#x201d; Fetterman complained in a letter to a friend. (5) <br><br>The mounted men chased the decoys down the slope and along a lengthy shoulder of parched yellow ground. The troops became strung out, their boots and their horses&#x2019; hooves kicking up dust. Occasionally a cavalryman paused and fired a burst from his light carbine rifle. <br><br>Ahead, as the Indians raced across the prairie mounds, they did something curious. Two parties suddenly cut across each other&#x2019;s paths, riding toward each other, and then swerving away again.<br><br>This was the signal for attack.<br><br>On either side of the trail, the warriors rose from the golden brown prairie. It was as if the whole crust of the earth suddenly burst upward. Waves of arrows arced up from the gullies and draws. Pony hooves thrummed over rock and soil. <br><br>Months of preparation and pent-up aggression went into the attack. The battle plan was the work of Red Cloud, leader of the Oglala&#x2013;Lakota. (6) For years, the Lakota had watched whites encroach on their hunting grounds, and they were furiously determined to shut down the new Bozeman passage. In 1840, the first small wagon train of settlers had crossed through to the Pacific. By 1848, huge lines of prairie schooners snaked westward, including Brigham Young&#x2019;s parade of 397 wagons. With them came a variety of pestilences, including Asiatic cholera, measles, and smallpox. (7)<br><br>Most important, they rousted the wildlife, particularly the allproviding buffalo, which gave the Lakota every element of their livelihoods. The Lakota, highly attuned naturalists, had a practical understanding of the famine that could result from the smallest disruption of their hunting patterns, one drought that came across the prairie as if blown from an eagle&#x2013;bone whistle.<br><br>While American Horse couldn&#x2019;t have known the precise facts of white emigration, his own eyes told him that it was becoming a real threat to Lakota sustenance. He understood that, &#x201c;unless the white people could be kept out of the buffalo country, they were doomed, so far as being a free and independent people was concerned. They would have a strange master to look to for existence,&#x201d; according to a white friend, the famed scout, cattleman, and sharpshooter James Cook. (8) <br><br>The Lakota in their dominant years were many things: hunters, natural philosophers, tireless orators, and seekers who felt that the ephemeral was graspable with deep concentration. But they were<br>something else, too, when threatened: absolutely lethal combatants.<br><br>There was no better example than American Horse, the picture of flourishing Lakota male splendor. He was born in 1840, the son of a tribal leader named Sitting Bear, and he was of ancient stock, with a family winter count, the equivalent of a calendar, that went back five generations. His lineage showed in his handsome features, which exuded entitlement, vanity, and resolve. He was tall and deepchested, with a face that looked as though it had been stroked with a knife out of wood. His mouth bowed downward, grim with purpose, and elongating his features were thick plaits falling over his shoulders, wrapped in cloth.<br><br>As a boy, he learned to hunt buffalo through the snow, on foot, with a bow and arrow. From the age of five or six years on, he played the Lakota war games that prepared braves for their adult responsibilities&#x2014; games not unlike football. One of them was a harrowing contest called Throwing Them off Their Horses, a form of mock battle in which mounted boys lined up and charged at each other. As the ponies collided and floundered in a dust cloud, the riders seized each other, wrestling. They played until all of the men on one side were unhorsed. (9)<br><br>By the age of about fourteen, American Horse had fought victoriously against half a dozen enemy tribes. At eighteen, he earned his adult name of American Horse (Wasicu Tasunke) when he captured a large Army horse and rode it into battle and slew an enemy. In 1864, he was appointed a &#x201c;shirt wearer,&#x201d; or leader, in the same ceremony with Crazy Horse. &#x201c;The following are the names of the Indians I scalped and stole horses from: the Shoshonies, Arapahoes, Bannocks, Nez Perces, Blackfeet, Piegans, Assinaboines, Arikarees, Omahas, and white men,&#x201d; he said later in his life. &#x201c;I defeated every tribe of the above named Indians that I came in contact with. That is what made me chief.&#x201d; (10)<br><br>By the time of the Fetterman battle in 1866, American Horse was a canny and commanding warrior, fully engaged in the campaign to drive out the whites. Just a few weeks earlier, in a similar ambush, American Horse had served as a deputy to Red Cloud in an attack on a train of forty wagons that killed fourteen emigrants. But they wanted larger prey: soldiers.<br><br>American Horse joined the frenzied battle. The air filled with the whine of arrows, black gunpowder, and dust. Horses wheeled, crazed, with arrows in their flanks. Infantrymen struggled clumsily to reload their outdated, single&#x2013;shot, muzzle&#x2013;loading Springfield rifles, pawing at the cartridge boxes at their waists as cold bit into their fingers. To a Lakota named Fire Thunder, the arrows slinging overhead from the gullies seemed &#x201c;like a cloud of grasshoppers all above and around the soldiers.&#x201d; (11) Men staggered around with arrows in them. Others wobbled and fell down insensible, their heads crushed by blows from war clubs.<br><br>Fetterman and his men alternately fought and clambered back up the trail toward the split rocks that offered the only possible cover. Their belted greatcoats encumbered them, and their heavy Jefferson boots slipped on the icy ground, which became stained with sheets of red ice, blood freezing in rivulets down the hillside. For a few minutes, Fetterman held together a band of soldiers among the rocks. But the boulders were only knee high, and the Indians steadily encircled, crawling toward them over the ground or galloping their ponies up the hill. The besieged soldiers fought with increasing terror and hopelessness. Combat became a horror, with men swinging gunstocks to fend off the hatchets, stone clubs, and thrusting knives.<br><br>There are conflicting accounts about what happened next. Carrington, who was not there and may have wished to perpetuate a noble story for the sake of the families, claimed Fetterman and Captain Fred Brown placed revolvers to each other&#x2019;s temples and pulled the triggers before the Indians could kill them. However, the report of the post surgeon who examined the bodies contradicted him. &#x201c;Col. Fetterman&#x2019;s body showed his thorax to have been cut crosswise with a knife, deep into the viscera; his throat and entire neck were cut to the cervical spine, all around. I believe that mutilation to have caused his death.&#x201d; (12)<br><br>Years later, American Horse gave his own account of Fetterman&#x2019;s death. According to this version, American Horse and Fetterman, each the manful pride of his people, met on the hillside. The Lakota warrior galloped his mount toward the rocks, hurtled into the midst of the bluecoats, and ran his horse full speed at Fetterman, knocking him down. He then leaped from his horse, seized Fetterman around the neck, and slashed a knife across his throat&#x2013;apparently with so much force that he almost beheaded him. (13)<br><br>It took only about ninety minutes from the time the first volley was fired until the last soldier died. Victorious, the Indians began to ritually mutilate the bodies, which they believed incapacitated their enemies in the afterlife. They stripped off overcoats and trousers, shook money and trinkets out of pockets, and kept what they liked. Then they sliced open arms, legs, and abdomens, pulled out muscles and organs, gouged out eyes, cut out tongues, and removed genitals. They cut the tops off skulls and removed the brains, and pulled arms out of sockets. <br><br>A soldier&#x2019;s dog darted from the rocks. One brave suggested that they let the dog run to the fort and carry the news of the battle. Another thought he was too sweet to shoot. Yet another said, &#x201c;No, do<br>not let even a dog get away.&#x201d; (14) They shot the animal full of arrows. The dog fell to the ground, one more dead thing on a field strewn for a mile with the corpses of Fetterman&#x2019;s command, as well as those of horses, shattered weapons, and an almost incredible number of arrows. One soldier&#x2019;s body had 165 arrows in it. (15) <br><br>A relief party of soldiers appeared on a high ridge to the east. The sharp, rapid volleys of fire had been clearly audible at the fort. As Captain Tenedor Ten Eyck stared down from the summit of the ridge at the valley below flooded with Indians, he could see no trace of the bluecoats.<br><br>But as the throngs of warriors began to recede from the valley, the battlefield gradually became visible. The soldiers spotted what at first looked like cottonwood limbs, stripped of bark. An infantryman suddenly called out.<br><br>&#x201c;There are the men down there, they are all dead!&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Chillingly, the Indians began to taunt this second group of soldiers to come down the hill. They catcalled, shrieked, showed their naked buttocks to the soldiers and slapped them. The soldiers did not dare move from the high ground.</p><h2>Paganism Explained: Part I: Thrymskvida</h2><p>The first book in a series where we unveil the Native European deities.

In<i> Ham Biscuits, Hostess Gowns and Other Southern Specialties</i> Julia Reed collects her thoughts on good cooking and the lessons of gracious entertaining that pass from one woman to another, and takes the reader on a lively and very personal tour of the culinary&#x2014;and social&#x2014;South. In essays on everything from pork chops to the perfect picnic Julia Reed&nbsp;revels in&nbsp;the simple good qualities that make the Southern table the best possible place to pull up a chair. She expounds on: the Southerner&#x2019;s relentless penchant for using gelatin; why most things taste better with homemade mayonnaise; the necessity of a holiday milk punch (and, possibly, a Santa hat); how best to &#x201c;cook for compliments&#x201d; (at least one squash casserole and Lee Bailey&#x2019;s barbequed veal are key). She provides recipes for some of the region&#x2019;s best-loved dishes (cheese straws, red velvet cake, breakfast shrimp), along with her own variations on the classics, including Fried Oysters Rockefeller Salad and Creole Crab Soup. She also elaborates on worthwhile information every hostess would do well to learn: the icebreaking qualities of a Ramos gin fizz and a hot crabmeat canap�, for example; the &#x201c;wow factor&#x201d; intrinsic in a platter of devilled eggs or a giant silver punchbowl filled with scoops of homemade ice cream.&nbsp;<i>Ham Biscuits, Hostess Gowns and Other Southern Specialties</i> another great book about the South from Julia Reed, a writer who makes her experiences in&#x2014;and out of&#x2014;the kitchen a joy to read. </p></p><p><p>JULIA REED is a contributing editor at<i> Newsweek</i>, where she writes the magazine's Food and Drink column.

I don't think it was on purpose; she just wanted to make everything in advance so she could spend as much time as possible with her friends. But by the end of the second day, when the guests had already consumed a crabmeat mousse, a strawberry mousse, two kinds of tomato aspic, and a charlotte russe, one complained that he could not get up from the table. "I think," he said, "my blood has coagulated."None of the rest of us saw anything funny about the food. This was in the Mississippi Delta, after all, where congealed items are a staple of our diets. In <i>Gourmet of the Delta,</i> a cookbook put together by the region's Episcopal churchwomen, there are seventy salad recipes, and fifty-one of them contain gelatin; in <i>The Memphis Cook Book,</i> twenty-three of the thirty-three salads are congealed. I didn't even bother to count the desserts. We congeal everything. Instead of serving Smithfield ham with hot mustard, we serve it with a shimmering hot mustard mousse. Rare roast beef gets horseradish mousse sliced and stacked with the beef on homemade yeast rolls. For hors d'oeuvres, we would rather offer a molded Roquefort ring (Roquefort, chopped pecans, cream, and cream cheese) thanmere Roquefort. Then there are the endless variations on tomato aspic, including my favorite--tomato soup aspic, a Junior League cookbook perennial made with canned tomato soup, mayonnaise, cream cheese, and sliced green olives.I had always assumed that the Southerner's proclivity toward anything made with gelatin derived from the heat. All those smooth and glistening aspics and mousses would have provided cool relief. In fact, it wasn't until the advent of refrigeration that we could enjoy them during most of the year. "Jellies should never be made in hot weather," Marion Cabell Tyree warns in <i>Housekeeping in Old Virginia,</i> published in 1879. In <i>Dishes and Beverages of the Old South,</i> published in 1913, Martha McCulloch-Williams describes a typical wedding menu, adding that in cold weather, wine jelly "took the place of syllabub."It turns out that our fondness for jelled foods comes from the British, who began making molded "jellies" as early as medieval times, when artistic cooks decorated them with edible gold and silver. Techniques for making them weren't perfected until toward the end of the eighteenth century when they became symbols of sophistication and status. No wonder. To make them was such a long and tedious process, only the wealthy could afford it. First, calves' feet and knuckles or hartshorn (deer antlers) were simmered in water for hours and allowed to cool, leaving a translucent jelly on the top. The jelly was further reduced by boiling, clarified with egg whites, and flavored with everything from fruit and wine or cream to ground meat or nuts. A typical example is "The Duchess of Montague's Receipt for Hartshorn Jelly" from an eighteenth-century manuscript found at Canons Ashby in Northamptonshire. In it, the cook is advised to "put in one gallon of water half a pound of Hartshorn. Let them boyl slowly till the Liquor is a prettystrong Jelly, then strain it off and put in ... the peel of eight oranges and four lemons, cut very thin, boyl it a quarter of an hour, then put in the whites of 12 eggs ... the Juice of the Oranges and Lemons, and a pound and a quarter of double refined Sugar, boyl it a little and then strain it through a Flannell Bagg."In Colonial America, gelatin was not such an indicator of class. In her cookbook, Tyree points out that it was easy for "country housekeepers in particular to make this sort of jelly, as the materials generally are within their reach." Isinglass, a jelling agent made from the air bladders of sturgeon was also popular, and by the 1860s, some crude commercial gelatins (sold in paper-thin "leaves") were available. Tyree was partial to Cox's Sparkling Gelatin, and included it in recipes for blanc mange, Bavarian cream, charlotte russe, "meat jelly for boned turkey," and "lemon froth." However, Isinglass required almost as much boiling and straining as calves' feet and hartshorn, and the early leaf gelatin was not always foolproof. Finally, in 1890 the process for making granulated commercial gelatin was perfected by Charles Knox, a fact that made him so rich he bought the famous racehorse Anaconda and gave him the unfortunate new moniker "Gelatine King."While gelatin is defined in <i>The New Food Lover's Companion</i> as "pure protein derived from beef and veal bones, cartilage, tendons, and other tissue," most commercial gelatin today is a by-product of pigskin. This information must be startling to those vegetarians who ingest commercial ice cream, yogurt, gummy bears, and the hundreds of other prepared foods containing gelatin, not to mention the "gel caps" that encase an increasing number of over-the-counter medicines. Since I am not a vegetarian I am grateful for those handy quarter-ounce envelopes of instant gelatin. My friends and I spent much of our teen years drinking dissolved Knoxstraight out of a glass in an effort to make our hair shiny and our nails strong. (These days there is a product called Knox for Nails.) But my devotion to Knox reached its apex just a few years ago, after I'd apparently lost my mind and tried jelling something the old-fashioned way.I was in Bath, England, for the summer and in charge of organizing an enormous picnic to take to a country-house cricket match. One of the guests was originally from New Orleans and her favorite thing in life is daube glac�, a highly seasoned beef stew that is jellied and molded in a loaf pan. Served on crusty French bread with lots of homemade mayonnaise, it makes an extremely upscale and delicious New Orleans roast beef po'boy sandwich, and I was determined to show the Brits a thing or two. Maybe it was the English damp, or maybe it was all the hours of mind-numbing cricket I'd been forced to watch. At any rate I forgot all about Mr. Knox and followed the only recipe I could find in the Bath bookstore, which included plenty of calves' feet and veal knuckles but no granulated gelatin. It didn't work. After about eight hours of simmering and two days of refrigeration it ended up a sort of glutinous beef soup, which I finally heated up and served over noodles the day after the picnic.I have since learned to forgo the animal parts and add four envelopes of gelatin (one envelope usually will jell about two cups of liquid). Now that I have perfected my daube glac� I intend to serve it at my own next house party, where I'll have no qualms about thickening the blood of my guests. Over the course of the weekend I'll probably also offer a tomato aspic ring filled with lump crabmeat or a curried rice salad, a boozy charlotte russe with homemade ladyfingers, Julia Child's divine chicken mousse with foie gras and truffles, and maybe even some wine jelly, although that is mostoften served during the Christmas holidays, in keeping with its original seasonal roots.While I cook, I'll entertain myself by listening to Rogers and Hart--specifically "I Wish I Were in Love Again," surely the only song ever written that successfully incorporates the verb "congeal" into its lyrics. "When love congeals," Lorenz Hart wrote in one of his archer moments, "it soon reveals the faint aroma of performing seals." I will also raise a glass to the rather gauche Mr. Knox, whose gelatin has no aroma whatsoever, and when it congeals the result is not dull or disastrous, as in the song, but shimmering and divine.CHARLOTTE RUSSEYIELD: 8 TO 10 SERVINGS&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>1/2 cup milk 2 tablespoons unflavored gelatin 4 cups heavy cream 11/2 cups sugar 5 eggs, separated 1/2 cup bourbon or brandyPlace the milk in a small saucepan and sprinkle with the gelatin.

Using a sifter or sieve, sift a fourth of the flour on top, and with a rubber spatula, fold the ingredients until partly blended. Repeat until all the egg whites are incorporated, but don't try to blend the mixture too thoroughly (the batter should remain light and puffy).Using a spoon or pastry bag, spread or pipe the batter in 4 by 11/2-inch strips spaced 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.Bake the ladyfingers in the middle and upper third of the oven for about 20 minutes, or until very pale brown and slightly crusty on the outside.

The crisis has not been resolved. From a certain point of view it is still as serious as it ever was, as it is primarily a crisis of faith, hence a moral and social crisis." <br><b>&#x2015; Pope Benedict XVI</b></p><p>The apparitions in 1917 of the Blessed Virgin Mary to three peasant children in Fatima, Portugal, are perhaps the most important private revelations in the history of the Church. At the height of World War I and on the eve of the Russian Revolution, Our Lady appeared in Fatima to warn us of another even greater world war, the spread of Communism, and a terrible persecution of the Church unless people returned to God. She asked for us to offer daily prayer and sacrifice for conversion of the world and salvation of souls.</p><p>Because of the prophetic nature of Our Lady's messages and their potential significance for the entire world, they have been the subject of much study and controversy, and they have influenced the decisions not only of many individuals, but also of Popes, Bishops, and heads of state.</p><p>To celebrate the 100th anniversary of these important apparitions and messages for the modern world, renowned author-photographer team Grzegorz G�rny and Janusz Rosikon traveled throughout Europe to tell the story of Fatima and its impact on the destiny of both individuals and nations. With stunningly beautiful four-color photographs on every page, and in-depth detail and insights on all aspects of the story and message of Fatima, they probe the mysteries of Fatima and their continued relevance for our modern age. <b>Lavishly Illustrated.</b></p></p><p>Grzegorz Gorny is a reporter, essayist, and film and television producer.

Rather, they were invented by Martin Luther, John Calvin, and others.</p><p>That is a serious charge, and one that evangelicals must be ready to answer.

For example, women who are victims of domestic abuse are often so paralyzed with the stigma of shame associated with their abuse, they don&#x2019;t seek help. <strong>The Compassionate-Mind Guide to Recovering from Trauma and PTSD</strong> helps readers reduce the sense of threat they constantly feel and develop a fuller understanding of their reactions to trauma by cultivating compassion for themselves and others. The practical exercises based in compassion-focused therapy (CFT) that are offered in this book help readers gradually confront and overcome trauma-related behaviors. This approach invites readers who have undergone a traumatic experience to develop compassion for themselves and others, a sense of safety, and the ability to self-soothe when difficult memories or emotions arise. Written by an international expert on PTSD treatment, this book will prove to be an essential resource for therapists specializing in the treatment of trauma and anyone in the process of healing from a traumatic experience.</p></p><p><p> <strong>Deborah A.

The tale begins with young Takeo, a member of a subversive and persecuted religious group, who returns home to find his village in flames. He is saved, not by coincidence, by the swords of Lord Otori Shigeru and thrust into a world of warlords, feuding clans, and political scheming. As Lord Otori's ward, he discovers he is a member by birth of the shadowy "Tribe," a mysterious group of assassins with supernatural abilities. <p> Hearn sets his tale in an imaginary realm that is and isn't feudal Japan. This device serves the author well as he is able to play with familiar archetypes--samurai, Shogun, and ninja--without falling prey to the pitfalls of history. The novel fills a unique niche that is at once period piece and fantasy novel. Hearn unfolds the tale of Takeo and the conflicting forces around him in a deliberate manner that leads to a satisfying conclusion and sets the stage for the rest of the series. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>Lian Hearn is the pseudonym for the writer Gillian Rubinstein, currently living in Australia, who has a lifelong interest in Japan, has lived there, and speaks Japanese.

Had the thought actually crossed my mind, I would have immediately relegated it to that crowded portion of my brain where things <i>I should do someday but thankfully never will</i> are safely locked away to languish and die.</p><p>The idea was my daughter McKenna's. Three months before she graduated from high school, her sociology teacher, a graying, long-haired Haight-Ashbury throwback who had traded in his tie-dye T-shirts for tweed jackets with leather elbow patches presented to his class the opportunity to go to South America on a humanitarian mission. McKenna became obsessed with the idea and asked if I would accompany her on such an excursion -- kind of a daddy-daughter date in the Amazon.</p><p>I agreed. Not that I had any real desire or intention of going. I figured that she would soon graduate and her mind would be occupied with other concerns. I never believed it would really come about.</p><p>I should have known my daughter better. Four months later I found myself standing with her and a dozen of her former classmates in the Salt Lake City airport boarding a plane for Lima, Peru.</p><p>Unbeknownst to our little group, we had entrusted our lives to novices. We were the first group our expeditionary guides had actually led into the Amazon -- a fact we discovered twenty-four hours later deep in a jungle teeming with anacondas, jaguars and hand-sized spiders. Several times in the course of our expedition, our guide, an elderly Peruvian man, would suddenly stop, lay his machete at the foot of a tree, then climb above the jungle canopy for a look, each time descending with a somewhat perplexed expression.</p><p>After our third complete change of course I asked our guide (as tactfully as one being led through a jungle must) if he knew where he was going. In broken English the old man replied, "Yes, I have been here before..." then added, "when I was six."</p><p>During our hike we came upon the village of an Amazonian tribe, the Los Palmos. Overjoyed to learn that they were neither cannibals nor headhunters, we soon noticed that the population of the village included no young men, only women and the elderly. Our guide asked one of the natives where all the young men had gone.</p><p>"They have gone to town to kill the mayor," she replied.</p><p>"Why?" our guide asked.</p><p>"The mayor has said we can no longer cut the rainforest trees. We cannot live without the wood from the trees. So our men have gone to kill him."</p><p>"Do you think that's a good idea?" our guide asked.</p><p>The woman shrugged. "Probably not, but it's how things are done in the jungle."</p><p>There was something refreshing about her logic. I've never been overly fond of politics, and the image of painted tribesmen carrying spears and bows into town hall delighted me -- certainly something we don't see enough of in Salt Lake City. I still wonder how that all turned out.</p><p>Two days into our journey we ran out of food. For several days we lived on jungle fruit and the piranhas we caught in the river. (Piranha doesn't taste that bad -- kind of like chicken.)</p><p>I remember, as a boy, sitting spellbound through a Saturday afternoon matinee about a school of piranhas that terrorized a small jungle village. These Hollywood piranhas swam in conveniently slow-moving schools that cinematically frothed and bubbled on the surface, allowing the hero a chance to swim across the river and rescue a woman just inches ahead of the churning piranha death.</p><p>The piranhas we encountered in the jungle were nothing like that. First, Amazon piranhas are nearly as ubiquitous in the jungle as vegetation. Drop a fishing line in any jungle river and within seconds it will be bitten. Usually in half. Second, there are no warning bubbles.</p><p>Adding crocodiles, electric eels and leeches to the mix, we decided it best to just keep out of the water.</p><p>After several days of traveling we reached our destination, a small village where we established our clinic. The Quechuan natives were waiting for us.</p><p>The goal of our humanitarian mission was threefold: teach basic hygiene, fix teeth and correct vision. I was assigned to the latter. The optometrist who hiked in with us would conduct an eye examination, then hand me a written prescription for eyeglasses that I would attempt to fill from the bags of used eyewear we had packed into the jungle.</p><p>I remember one patient in particular. He was an elderly man, small featured and sun-baked, his skin as leathery as a baseball glove. And he had just one eye. As he was led from his exam to my station, the doctor handed me a blank prescription.</p><p>"What do I do with this?" I asked.</p><p>"Find the thickest lens you can find," he replied. "He's all but blind."</p><p>I knew the pair. Earlier, as I was organizing the glasses, I had come across a pair of lenses so thick I was certain they were bulletproof. I retrieved them and placed them on the little man's face. I soon learned that he had not just one eye, but also just one tooth as a broad smile blanketed his face. <i>"!Puedo ver!"</i> he exclaimed. <i>I can see!</i></p><p>It was my daughter's job to tend the children as the doctors treated their parents. Indelibly etched in my mind is a sweet mental picture of my daughter as I looked out to see her running and screaming in mock terror from a throng of bare-chested little boys, who were laughing so hard they would occasionally fall to the ground holding their stomachs.</p><p>As we left the village, the children gathered around her and she hugged each of them. We sat together in the back of the bus, and she grew very quiet. After a few minutes I asked her what she had learned from this experience. She thought about it a moment, then said, "We love those whom we serve."</p><p>We moved on by boat up the muddy Rio Madre de Dios past the camps of the illicit gold miners scarring the forest with their bulldozers and sluices, eventually coming to a small clearing in the jungle. An airfield. Boarding a cargo plane, we flew south to Cuzco, where we took buses up into the Andes Mountains to a rundown hacienda.</p><p>The hacienda had been magnificent once, with elaborate tiles and intricate woodwork. It had a stone courtyard, a balcony and a bell tower. But the opulence of centuries ago was gone now, and what remained, rotting and looted, provided barely adequate shelter for the orphan boys it now housed. The place was called El Girasol -- the Sunflower -- and it was in the business of saving street children.</p><p>Among all the people we encountered in this mystical land, it was here that we met the most memorable: an American by the name of Paul Cook.</p><p>I was told by one of our guides that Paul Cook had once been a successful emergency room physician. Up until one Christmas Day when everything changed.</p><p>One night, after we had completed our day's tasks, we sat around a fire recounting the day's events as darkness closed in around us. Gradually our group retired to their sleeping quarters and I found myself alone with this quiet, intriguing man. We talked mostly about America; about the NBA, current movies, the Oscars and whom I thought would win the next presidential election. When I had satisfied his curiosity about current events, I asked him what prompted him to come to Peru. He just stared into the fire. Then he said, without looking at me, "That's a long story."</p><p>"No clocks in the jungle," I said.</p><p>Still gazing into the fire, he smiled at the use of one of his own favorite phrases. After a moment he said, "I'll show you."</p><p>He led me through the labyrinth of the hacienda to a small windowless cell with a wooden floor and a high ceiling. The room was as austere as any I had seen in the orphanage and was lit by a single lightbulb hanging from a cord from the exposed rafters. There were a few simple pieces of furniture: a small tin washbasin, a crate for a desk with a wooden chair and a bed that was just a mattress on box springs set on wooden blocks.</p><p>And there were books. Lots of books, visibly well-read and stacked in sloppy piles against the wall. I scanned the titles. Classics and bestsellers, <i>Reader's Digest</i> compilations, medical journals and crossword puzzles, biographies and thrillers. Books in Spanish as well as English. There were a few love stories.</p><p>On the wall above the books were two framed photographs: one of an elderly couple I guessed to be his parents, the other of a beautiful young woman whom I was to learn was named Christine. The most peculiar adornment to the room was a movie poster: a moody, black and indigo poster of a man kissing a woman beneath a title written in Italian: <i>Cinema Paradiso.</i></p><p>Paul let me take in the surroundings for a moment before motioning for me to sit on the bed. I noticed that he had something in his hand -- a hand-sewn leather pouch. He untied its drawstrings and took from it a small toy soldier and handed it to me. Then he sat down next to me and commenced his tale. An hour or so later, when he was done, he looked weary and spent and I could sense the walls rising again in his demeanor, as if maybe he feared that he had shared too much. He restored the soldier to its pouch, hanging it by its drawstrings to a nail on the wall.</p><p>I asked if I could share his story. He showed little interest in my request but said he would sleep on it, a reply I also understood as my dismissal. Three days later, just a few hours before we were to fly back to Lima, he agreed.</p><p>It's been said, <i>Seek not your destiny for it is seeking you.</i> Paul Cook's story reveals, as well as any I suppose, that this is true. It was equally true for a young woman named Christine, who went to the jungle looking for anything but love.</p><p>This is their story.</p><p>Copyright � 2005 by Richard Paul Evans</p></p><h2>Destined to Reign Devotional: Daily Reflections for Effortless Success, Wholeness and Victorious Living</h2><p>These 365 dynamic devotions will inspire readers that they can reign over every adversity, lack, and destructive habit limiting them from experiencing the success, wholeness, and victory they were destined to enjoy. <p> Joseph Prince, pastor of New Creation Church with over 15,000 members, reveals the amazing and powerful grace of God that gives readers the ability to live like Christ in a world of adversity.

But when it comes to underlying desires, the jury is out. Some Christians view homosexual desire as morally neutral, while others believe it calls for repentance and gospel renewal.<br><br>Is same-sex attraction sinful, even if it is not acted on? How we answer this urgent question determines how we counsel brothers and sisters who wrestle with same-sex desires. Denny Burk and Heath Lambert challenge misconceptions on all sides as they unpack the concepts of same-sex orientation, temptation, and desire. They show that ultimately a biblical view gives hope for profound personal change, with patterns remolded and rethought in faithfulness to Christ.</p><p><b>Denny Burk</b> (PhD, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is professor of biblical studies at Boyce College. He has served as the editor of The Journal for Biblical Manhood &amp; Womanhood and blogs at dennyburk.com, where he frequently deals with gender and sexuality from a biblical perspective.<br><br><b>Heath Lambert</b> (PhD, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is executive director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors and Associate Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville, FL. He is also a visiting faculty member at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary."Denny Burk and Heath Lambert have written a clear, compassionate, and thought-provoking book on how the gospel brings transformation to those struggling with homosexuality. Our hope is not the heterosexuality-or-bust shtick of reparative therapy, but the wondrous prospect of growing in holiness and Christlikeness that comes through repentance and faith. This is essential reading for every pastor and for any seeking to bless and minister to those with same-sex attraction in our churches." --<b>Sam Allberry</b>, Associate Minister of St Mary's Church, Maidenhead UK; author of <i>Is God Anti-Gay?</i> and <i>James For You</i><br><br>"In <i>Principles of Conduct</i>, John Murray reminds us that 'the line of demarcation between virtue and vice is not a chasm but a razor's edge.' In <i>Transforming Homosexuality</i>, Denny Burk and Heath Lambert shine scholarly and pastoral light on that razor's edge, helping Christians to discern the difference between sexual temptation and sexual lust as it bears on same-sex attraction. This is a bold and provocative book. It will also likely be a controversial book. But it is predominantly a loving book that seeks to help people with unwanted homosexual desires be transformed by the full knowledge that God's grace for us in Christ is sufficient for all our various struggles and sins." --<b>Rosaria Butterfield</b><br><br>"Under pressure from worldly trendsetters, many in the church (including several key evangelical leaders) have adopted the position that homosexual desire may in some sense be normal. Homosexual acts are sinful, they say, but a homosexual orientation is not inherently unrighteous. In <i>Transforming Homosexuality</i>, Denny Burk and Heath Lambert address that idea with biblical clarity and godly wisdom. This is an important book about an issue that has overwhelmed our culture." --<b>John MacArthur</b></p><h2>Destined To Win: How to Embrace Your God-Given Identity and Realize Your Kingdom Purpose</h2><p><p><strong>Pastor and cofounder of the Bethel School of Ministry Kris Vallotton walks Christians through the profound process of discovering their true identity and experiencing the wonder of their kingdom purposes.</strong></p><p>Christians are often told that they were born with a purpose that reaches beyond their human strivings, but most are not sure how to break past the daily struggles holding them back, much less how to fully step into their callings.</p><p>As a pastor and the cofounder of the Bethel School of Ministry, Kris Vallotton has been teaching Christians all over the world how to walk in wholeness and purpose for more than seventeen years.

Before the party is over, all the states decide to switch places. </p><p>In the beginning, every state is happy in its new location. But soon things start to go wrong. Florida, who switches spots with Minnesota, is freezing in the frosty northern climate, and Minnesota hasn't brought sunscreen and is getting an awful sunburn. Will the states ever unscramble themselves and return to their proper places?</p><p>Packed with madcap humor and whimsical illustrations, this quirky story--starring all fifty states--is chock-full of introductory facts and silly antics that will make learning geography as much fun as taking a vacation.</p><p>This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p>One day, Kansas wakes up grumpy. The other 49 states are stretching, yawning, and pouring maple syrup onto each other's pancakes, but irritable Kansas announces to his kindly neighbor Nebraska that life is dull and changes <i>must</i> be made: "All day long we just sit here in the middle of the country. We never GO anywhere. We never DO anything, and we NEVER meet any NEW states!" Nebraska, sick of hearing North Dakota and South Dakota bicker all the time, agrees to help organize a party for all the states. It's a hit! Late into the evening, Idaho and Virginia get up onto the stage and suggest that all the states change places. What a state of affairs. Minnesota, who switches places with Florida, gets a sunburn. Kansas, having traded places with Hawaii, gets lonely and sings some soggy blues so sad that a shark sheds a mournful tear offshore. Nevada and Mississippi fall in love. Despite the initial excitement, the new arrangement just doesn't feel right. The states manage to swim, fly, bike, and hitchhike their way home, and everyone goes to bed in the right place--even Kansas is happy to be home after such an adventure. This wacky, thoroughly engaging tale of mixed-up geography is a good bet for some awards. Perhaps best of all, the large format and riot of detail allow for plenty of amusing asides. Books that claim to "make geography fun" usually have to be taken with a dose of skepticism: so often, the teaching is there and the entertainment isn't. This delightfully quirky and original book shows how it should be done.

The <i>real</i> Henry Ford was a tangle of contradictions. He set off the consumer revolution by producing a car affordable to the masses, all the while lamenting the moral toll exacted by consumerism. He believed in giving his workers a living wage, though he was entirely opposed to union labor. He had a warm and loving relationship with his wife, but sired a son with another woman. A rabid anti-Semite, he nonetheless embraced African American workers in the era of Jim Crow. Uncovering the man behind the myth, situating his achievements and their attendant controversies firmly within the context of early twentieth-century America, Watts has given us a comprehensive, illuminating, and fascinating biography of one of America&#x2019;s first mass-culture celebrities.</p><p>Henry Ford, a major architect of modern America, has lived on in the imagination of his fellow citizens as an enduring figure of fascination, an inimitable individual, a controversial personality, and a social visionary from the moment his Model T brought the automobile to the masses and triggered the consumer revolution. But never before has his outsized genius been brought to life so vividly as by Steven Watts in this major new biography. Watts, the author of the much acclaimed "The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life, has produced a superbly researched study of a man who was a bundle of contradictions. <br>Ford was the entrepreneur who first made the automobile affordable but who grew skeptical of consumerism's corrosive impact on moral values, an employer who insisted on a living wage for his workers but stridently opposed unions, who established the assembly line but worried about its effect on the work ethic, who welcomed African Americans to his company in the age of Jim Crow but was a rabid anti-Semite. He was the private man who had a warm, loving marriage while siring a son with a mistress; a father who drove his heir, Edsel, so relentlessly that it contributed to his early death; a folksy social philosopher and at one time, perhaps, the most popular figure in America, who treated his workers so harshly that they turned against him; creator of the largest, most sophisticated factory in the world who preferred spending time in his elaborate re-creation of a nineteenth-century village; and the greatest businessman of his age who haplessly lost control of his own company in his declining years. <br>Watts poignantly shows us how a Michigan farm boy frommodest circumstances emerged as one of America's richest men and one of its first mass-culture celebrities, one who became a folk hero to millions of ordinary citizens because of his support of high wages and material abundance for everyday workers and yet also excited the admiration of figures as diverse as Vladimir Lenin and Adolf Hitler, John D. Rockefeller and Woodrow Wilson. <br>Disclosing the man behind the myth and situating his achievements and controversies firmly within the context of early twentieth-century America, Watts has given us a comprehensive, illuminating biography of an American icon.<p>Steven Watts is a historian and writer who has charted the sweeping evolution of American culture in a number of highly-praised books. His series of biographies of major figures&#x2014;Henry Ford, Dale Carnegie, Walt Disney, Hugh Hefner&#x2014;has explored the shaping of a modern value-system devoted to consumerism, self-fulfillment, leisure, and personality. Two earlier books on the Early Republic era examined the shift from an older society of republican virtue to a 19th-century Victorian era devoted to self-control, individual character, and the self-made man.&nbsp;<br><br>Watts&#x2019; books have led to involvement in a number of media projects, including several films for PBS, the History Channel, and documentary venues in Germany and Brazil. He also has appeared in a variety of programs on CBS, NBC, CNBC, NPR, Fox, Fox News, C-Span, Bloomberg News, MSNBC, BBC, and Irish National Radio. He is currently a professor of history at the University of Missouri.</p></p><h2>Owen&#39;s Marshmallow Chick: An Easter And Springtime Book For Kids</h2><p><p>"My favorite," said Owen when he saw the marshmallow chick.</p><p>"My favorite," you will say when you read this book.</p></p><p>Owen adores Easter.

Their search takes them to the part of Central Florida known as Bone Valley, famous primarily for two things: a ruthless subculture of black-marketers who trade in illegal artifacts and fossils, and a multibillion-dollar phosphate industry whose strip mines compromise the very ground they walk on.<br><br>Neither enterprise tolerates nosy outsiders. For each, public exposure equals big financial losses&#x2014;and in a region built on a million-year accumulation of bones, there is no shortage of spots in which to hide a corpse. Or two.</p><p><b>Randy Wayne White</b> is the author of the Doc Ford novels and the Hannah Smith novels, including <i>Decieved</i>, <i>Night Moves</i>, and <i>Gone</i>. He is also the author of a number of nonfiction collections and of a cookbook. A onetime veteran fishing guide, he lives in an old house built on an Indian mound and spends much of his free time windsurfing, playing baseball, and hanging out at Doc Ford&#x2019;s Rum Bar &amp; Grille on Sanibel Island, Florida<b>ONE</b><br><br>A big chunk of central Florida is known as Bone Valley to geologists and antiquities thieves, as I was reminded by a stranger wearing braids and wrangler denim who appeared on my porch one stormy June morning.<br><br>The man claimed to be on the trail of artifacts stolen from Crow<br><br>tribal land in Montana.<br><br>&#x201c;Stone carvings about yay high,&#x201d; he said, holding his fingers apart. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t come from Bone Valley, but Florida is where a lot of tribal stuff ends up.&#x201d;<br><br>My stilthouse on Sanibel Island, the Gulf Coast, is four hours from Orlando, and two thousand miles from Big Sky Country. &#x201c;You sure you have the right Marion Ford?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Doc?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but not the kind you need.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A marine biologist who doesn&#x2019;t read his horoscope, that&#x2019;s what I<br><br>heard. You could be just the guy.&#x201d;<br><br>I was standing outside my lab, water slapping at pilings below<br>my feet, thunderheads sliding our way. &#x201c;What does astrology have to do with stolen artifacts?&#x201d;<br><br>The man, who had introduced himself as Duncan Fallsdown, said, &#x201c;Tonight, at what&#x2019;s supposed to be a sweat lodge, it would be nice to have a buffer. You know, someone who talks about some- thing other than Mother Earth and spirit quests&#x2014;all the standard stuff I&#x2019;ve heard a million times. A hawk circles overhead, a guy like you figures the bird&#x2019;s hungry, looking for a mouse. A snake, maybe. No big deal. Am I right?&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;A sweat lodge in June? If that&#x2019;s an invitation, no thanks.&#x201d; &#x201c;Not the best timing ,but I&#x2019;m committed,&#x201d; Fallsdown replied, his eyes moving to the bay where a sailboat was anchored. The boat&#x2019;s boom was strung with laundry that flapped in the breeze: a tie-dyed shirt, several sarongs, and what appeared to be women&#x2019;s lingerie.<br><br>Suddenly, the nonsensical was redefined as commonplace. &#x201c;Tomlinson&#x2019;s behind this,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How long have you known<br><br>him?&#x201d; I was referring to a lecherous, cannabis-growing anarchist turned Zen master who lives aboard the sailboat, an old Morgan, <i>No M�s </i>in faded script on the stern.<br><br>&#x201c;Long enough to leave last night, when he chugged a tray of Jell-O shooters and invited some women to go skinny-dipping,&#x201d; the man replied. &#x201c;That was around one. I flew in late yesterday afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>Yep&#x2014;definitely bras and panties clipped to the Morgan&#x2019;s hal- yard, all doomed to be soaked by the rain rumbling toward us. &#x201c;You <i>do </i>know him,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How many?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Women? At least one that was married, so I didn&#x2019;t bother count- ing. They&#x2019;re here because of the sweat lodge.&#x201d; Fallsdown considered the squall, then looked beyond me through the screen door. &#x201c;Man . . . you&#x2019;ve got a bunch of aquariums in there. As a kid, I always wanted one. What kind of fish?&#x201d;<br>It was a request to escape the rain, so I opened the door, asking, &#x201c;What time did Tomlinson start drinking this morning?&#x201d;<br><br>Fallsdown&#x2019;s shoulders filled the doorway, his Indian braids black on blue cowboy denim, and I got a whiff of what might have been smoke&#x2014;mesquite, maybe, not tobacco or marijuana.<br><br>&#x201c;Answer that one,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have to know what time he stopped last night, wouldn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br><br><b>DUNC A N FA L L S D O W N , </b>who told me to call him Dunk with a <i>k</i>, accepted a bottle of Gatorade after refusing a beer, saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hop-tose in- tolerant,&#x201d; which might have meant ten a.m. was too early&#x2014;or the gentle rebuff of an alcoholic. A man in his mid-forties acquires seis- mic markers at the corners of the eyes&#x2014;harsh winters, smoky bar- rooms, is what I saw.<br><br>I dumped my coffee and made fresh while wind blew the first fat drops of rain against the roof. Twice, while water boiled, I went to the door and whistled, then made small talk until Fallsdown fol- lowed me outside, across the breezeway, into the old ice house I have converted into a lab. I showed him around, explained what I do for a living&#x2014;collect and sell marine specimens, plus environmental consulting&#x2014;then went to the door again, &#x201c;When you crossed the boardwalk, did you happen to see a dog swimming around near my house?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was a <i>dog</i>?&#x201d; Fallsdown replied.<br><br>Surprise with a tinge of wariness&#x2014;the typical reaction of a new- comer who thinks he has seen what is probably an alligator but could be a giant otter. A few minutes later, I returned, and my yellow-eyed retriever was drying in the breezeway, a fresh bone to occupy him, while Fallsdown and I talked above the hiss of rain.<br>&#x201c;These stone carvings, someone I know wants them back. Dol- larwise, they&#x2019;re fairly valuable, but that&#x2019;s not the reason. The per- son&#x2019;s in a hurry. Tomorrow, there&#x2019;s a flea market near Venice I want to hit. Then a gun show in Lakeland.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know where the artifacts are?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got some contacts, and Tomlinson&#x2019;s working on some others&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here. MapQuest says the trip&#x2019;s three hours.&#x201d; Over an hour to Venice, then two hours to Lakeland, I guessed.<br><br>&#x201c;But double that if Tomlinson&#x2019;s driving.&#x201d;<br><br>Fallsdown, focusing on fish tanks along the wall, kept his back to me. &#x201c;You know the guy better than I do. He&#x2019;s not as flaky as he pretends, sometimes. He&#x2019;s got good instincts, too, and people trust him. Better than having just me show up, a cowboy-Indian dressed like Billy Jack, asking questions about artifacts that might sell for fifty, sixty grand. See what I&#x2019;m saying?&#x201d;<br><br>I was surprised by the numbers. &#x201c;At a flea market?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the sort of place dealers use now. Used to be, the quality stuff was sold at auctions or antiquities shows. Coins, arrowheads, fossils&#x2014;Florida had some of the biggest shows in the country. Vegas was big. New Mexico used to be, but the Indian relics trade has mostly gone underground. States are cracking down, Florida in- cluded, but it&#x2019;s still one of the world&#x2019;s best places for <i>finding </i>fossils and relics. The money&#x2019;s here, so the dealers keep coming.&#x201d;<br><br>I was sitting at my computer and broke a personal rule by turn- ing on the Wi-Fi before I&#x2019;d finished the morning grunt work re- quired of an aquarist who owns two boats. &#x201c;These artifacts, do you have a link where I can find photos?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a folder in my rental car when the rain slows down. The carvings don&#x2019;t look like much&#x2014;black soapstone&#x2014;steatite, it&#x2019;s called. Some say the pieces look like owl faces.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just the face?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Judge for yourself, but they&#x2019;re plain-looking stones. Not nearly as pretty as agate coral. They find a lot of that near Tampa, but other areas, too. Phosphate quarries are best.&#x201d;<br><br>There were plenty of quarries. . Phosphate mining has been a major Florida industry since the early 1900s, which Fallsdown al- ready knew.<br><br>&#x201c;A million years ago,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;inland Florida was high ground with rivers, and animals that collected there in the river basins and watering holes died there. That&#x2019;s why they call the area Bone Valley. Awesome fossils mixed in with stone tools from the Paleo era&#x2014;sort of one-stop shopping. Spend an afternoon digging the right spot, you could buy a car with what you find. Hell, a ranch, if you really got lucky.&#x201d; Fallsdown looked around, his expression congenial; he had the easygoing confidence of a plumber or a electrician, but that didn&#x2019;t quite mesh with his knowledge of Florida geology.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you a private investigator?&#x201d; &#x201c;Not hardly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Studied the field sciences in college?&#x201d; On the computer screen I had opened photos of agate corals, all polished pink, silver, or cinna- mon by the pressure of eons, each piece uniquely hollowed like a geode or miniature cave.<br><br>Fallsdown replied, &#x201c;Nope. But I did three years in the joint, two as library trustee&#x2014;Deer Lodge state prison. Lots of reading time.&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; while he focused on a hundred-gallon tank where I had isolated three fingerling snook&#x2014;a triad of silver blades sus-<br><br>pended above a mangrove diorama.<br><br>&#x201c;But you are a . . . a <i>member </i>of the Crow tribe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an Indian&#x2014;a Skin, if that&#x2019;s what you mean. You don&#x2019;t have to be careful around me. I make decent money putting on shows for<br>tourists, and the politically correct bullshit really gets old. That&#x2019;s how Tomlinson and I met. Sedona, Arizona. Sedona attracts every UFO kook and crystal worshipper around, but we hit it off. That was back in my drinking days, so I forgot what a pain in the ass he can be.&#x201d; Fallsdown put his face closer to the aquarium glass. &#x201c;What are those spiny things?&#x201d;<br><br>He meant the sea urchins. Then he asked about tunicates and barnacles&#x2014;their rhythmic, feathered appendages were actually modified legs&#x2014;and the anomaly of pregnant male sea horses, be- fore he got back to the subject. &#x201c;Look up &#x2018;Mastodon tusks&#x2019; and see what they sell for. Most are from phosphate quarries, or rivers south of Orlando. Maybe &#x2018;Clovis tools,&#x2019; too, or &#x2018;Charmstones,&#x2019; but don&#x2019;t get your hopes up. Dealers have stopped selling over the Internet.&#x201d;<br><br>The man sipped at his Gatorade while I banged away with two fingers at the keyboard. Then Fallsdown decided to trust me with more information.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my aunt who wants the carvings back. She did some crazy stuff after she ran off and left her husband and kids. Organized protests, the whole nine yards, even got her picture in newspapers when AIM had a standoff with the feds. Which sort of puts me in an awkward spot.&#x201d;<br><br>I stopped what I was doing and chose my words carefully. &#x201c;Awk- ward because of what your aunt did? Or because she . . . <i>knows </i>Tomlinson?&#x201d; My strange pal is a womanizer, and had mentioned his involvement with the American Indian Movement many times.<br><br>The man from Montana thought about that for a few seconds. &#x201c;Maybe that hippie snake did sleep with her&#x2014;it would explain a lot. But, no, what I mean is, she&#x2014;Rachel&#x2014;Rachel switched from being a radical to traditional a few years back. Now she has pancre- atic cancer. She says she can&#x2019;t die in peace until the carvings are<br>returned to the tribe. That&#x2019;s why I can&#x2019;t waste time with Tomlin- son&#x2019;s touchy-feely bullshit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have to find the artifacts before your aunt dies,&#x201d; I said. Rather than add <i>But she&#x2019;ll die anyway</i>, I swiveled around in my chair, done with the computer.<br><br>&#x201c;Find anything?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Enough,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A few years back, a complete mastodon tusk was stolen from a private collection. No photos, but it had primitive carving on it, a sort of lacework thatching. The thing was insured for half a million. Also a flint spearpoint&#x2014;&#x2018;orange plains chert,&#x2019; they call it&#x2014;supposedly worth ten thousand. You&#x2019;re right, nothing currently for sale on the Internet. I had no idea that kind of money was involved.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fossilized ivory,&#x201d; Fallsdown said. &#x201c;Is that the tusk they found in the Suwannee River? I heard it was a yard long and weighed fifty pounds. Paleo man&#x2014;the early Skins&#x2014;used ivory for weapons, but also as totems. That makes it a lot more valuable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because it was worked,&#x201d; I said, but was guessing.<br><br>&#x201c;Not only that, Ivory used by the Paleo Indians holds up better. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I&#x2019;d take the time to find out if I lived here. Some believe there&#x2019;s an Ice Age graveyard where mastodons went to die. Mammoths, too, probably, but I&#x2019;m not sure. Wouldn&#x2019;t that be something to find?&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;In Florida?&#x201d; The legend about elephant graveyards orig- inated in Africa, not Florida, and it had been debunked long ago.<br><br>Fallsdown gestured to indicate he kept an open mind.<br><br>I said what I had been thinking: &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re not here to sell something? Or do some collecting on your own?&#x201d;<br><br>Fallsdown remained unruffled. &#x201c;I might. Depends on how it goes tonight. I&#x2019;m supposed to do that sweat lodge for the wife and<br>daughters of a family in the phosphate business. They might know the names of serious collectors, because collectors drive the phosphate companies nuts, begging permission to hunt, trespassing. These women, or whoever runs the business, might have access to a list.&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;And you just happened to remember your good ol&#x2019; hippie buddy from the Sedona days.&#x201d; My tone was cool enough to be an accusation.<br><br>Fallsdown took it calmly, even smiled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I know all about that pond owned by a friend of yours, and the arrowheads, pottery, and other stuff you found in a cave. Tomlinson even offered to take me diving there, but no thanks, man. Find the two pieces I&#x2019;m after, I&#x2019;m outta here.&#x201d;<br><br>For Tomlinson&#x2014;who had nearly died in that pond&#x2014;to risk an- other dive said a lot about the respect he had for a man I had just insulted. I said, &#x201c;Sorry. It&#x2019;s a bad habit of mine, thinking when I should be listening. It&#x2019;s just that you know a lot about the relics trade for someone who&#x2019;s not an investigator or a tribal cop.&#x201d;<br><br>Fallsdown was pleased, not offended. &#x201c;See? You&#x2019;re a man who uses his head. That&#x2019;s what I was hoping. Why not tag along with Tomlinson and me, at least tonight? Might be good for you.&#x201d;<br><br>I asked, &#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well . . . I&#x2019;ll just come out and say it. I heard you got dumped by your girlfriend, and it might get your mind off things. The women are damn good-looking&#x2014;twin sisters and a blonde&#x2014;their step- mother, I guess. Used to be a big-time fashion model according to Tomlinson. We&#x2019;re taking a water taxi to a private island they own north of here.&#x201d;<br><br>As he spoke, my dog banged the door open with his nose . . . trotted toward Fallsdown, gave his hand a sniff . . . did the same to<br>me . . . then spun a few circles in the corner before collapsing on the floor.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not what you&#x2019;d call an affectionate animal, is he?&#x201d; Falls- down remarked, but sounded impressed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his name?<br><br>Instead of answering, I replied, &#x201c;Tomlinson has a big mouth. I wasn&#x2019;t dumped&#x2014;in fact, I had dinner with the woman he was talking about last night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Then you are still dating.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Umm . . . not exactly,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but it was a mutual decision. We&#x2019;re still good friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mutual, huh?&#x201d; He smiled, amused by the lie. &#x201c;Then invite her along. You&#x2019;ll understand why I need a buffer when you hear the whole story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I want to sweat, I&#x2019;ll wait &#x2019;til this rains stops and go stand in the parking lot,&#x201d; I told him.<br><br>Fallsdown&#x2019;s faith in me had been validated. <i>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; </i>he said. &#x201c;You can help me calm down Tomlinson after he finds out what I really have planned.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Summer Tree (Fionavar Tapestry)</h2><p><b>Taken to a realm of magic and war, five men and women from our world embark on an epic journey in the first novel in Guy Gavriel Kay&#x2019;s classic, critically acclaimed fantasy trilogy, The Fionavar Tapestry.</b><br><br>It begins with a chance meeting that introduces the five to a man who will change their lives: a mage who brings them to the first of all worlds, Fionavar.<br><br>In this land of gods and myth, each of them is forced to discover what they are and what they are willing to do, as Fionavar stands on the brink of a terrifying war against a dark, vengeful god...</p><p>It all began with a lecture that introduced five university students to a man who would change their lives, a wizard who could take them from Earth to the heart of the first of all worlds--Fionavar.

So he and Chewbacca head for a planet rumored to hide undreamedof riches. But once they get there, Han&#x2019;s beloved spacecraft, the Millennium Falcon, is hijacked by a band of assassins and killer robots. Their chances for survival are so slim, they might as well risk it all.</p><p>Han Solo soars again--in this awesome trilogy of his extraordinary exploits. Ride with him as he rides to the rescue, narrowly escapes certain death, and foils evil in its ruthelss tracks!IT&#x2019;S a warship all right. Damn!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Instrument panels in the Millennium Falcon&#x2019;s cockpit were alive with trouble lights, warning flashers, and the beeps and hoots of the sensor package. Readout screens were feeding combat-information displays at high speed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han Solo, crouched forward in the pilot&#x2019;s seat, coolly flicking his eyes from instrument to screen, hastily assessed his situation. His lean, youthful face creased in a frown of concern. Beyond the cockpit canopy, the surface of the planet Duroon drew steadily nearer. Somewhere below and astern, a heavily armed vessel had detected the Falcon&#x2019;s presence and was now homing in to challenge her. That the warship had, in fact, picked up the Millennium Falcon first was a matter of no small worry to Han; the ability to come and go without attracting notice, especially official notice, was vital to a smuggler.<br> &nbsp;<br> He began relaying fire-control data to the ship&#x2019;s weapons systems. &#x201c;Charge main batteries, Chewie,&#x201d; he said, not taking his eyes from his part of the console, &#x201c;and shields-all. We&#x2019;re in prohibited space; can&#x2019;t let &#x2019;em take us or identify the ship.&#x201d; Particularly, he added to himself, with the cargo we&#x2019;re hauling.<br> &nbsp;<br> To his right, Chewbacca the Wookiee made a sound halfway between a grunt and a bark, his furry fingers darting to his controls with sure dexterity, his large, hairy form hunched in the oversized copilot&#x2019;s seat. Wookiee-style, he showed his fierce fighting teeth as he rapidly surrounded the starship with layers of defensive energy. At the same time, he brought the Falcon&#x2019;s offensive weaponry up to its maximum charge.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bracing his ship for battle, Han berated himself for ever having taken on this job. He&#x2019;d known full well it could take him into conflict with the Corporate Sector Authority, in the middle of a steer-clear area.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Authority ship&#x2019;s approach left Han and Chewbacca just seconds for a clutch decision: abort the mission and head for parts unknown, or try to pull off their delivery anyway. Han surveyed his console, hoping for a clue, or a hit off the Cosmic Deck.<br> &nbsp;<br> The other ship wasn&#x2019;t gaining. In fact, the Falcon was pulling away. Sensors gauged the mass, armaments, and thrust of their pursuer, and Han made his best guess. &#x201c;Chewie, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a ship of the line; looks more like a bulk job, with augmentative weapons. She must&#x2019;ve just lifted off when she got wind of us. Hell, don&#x2019;t those guys have anything better to do?&#x201d; But it figured; the one major Authority installation on Duroon, the only one with a full-dress port layout, was on the far side of the globe, where the dawn line would just be lightening gray sky. Han had planned his landing for a spot as far away from the port as possible, in the middle of the night-side.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We take her down,&#x201d; he decided. If the Falcon could shake her follower, Han and Chewbacca could make their drop and, with the luck of the draw, escape.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Wookiee gave a grumpy growl, black nostrils flaring, tongue curling. Han glared at him. &#x201c;You got a better idea? It&#x2019;s a little late to part company, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; He took the converted freighter into a steep dive, throwing away altitude in return for increased velocity, heading deeper into Duroon&#x2019;s umbra.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Authority vessel, conversely, slowed even more, climbing through the planet&#x2019;s atmosphere, trading speed for altitude in an attempt to keep the Millennium Falcon under sensor surveillance. Han ignored the Authority&#x2019;s broadcast order to halt; telesponders that should have automatically given his starship&#x2019;s identity in response to official inquiry had been disconnected long ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hold deflector shields at full capacity,&#x201d; he ordered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking her down to the deck; we don&#x2019;t want our skins cooked off.&#x201d; The Wookiee complied, to shed thermal energy generated by the Falcon&#x2019;s rapid passage through the atmosphere. The starship&#x2019;s controls trembled as she began to buck the denser air Han worked to put the planet between himself and the Authority vessel.<br> &nbsp;<br> This he soon accomplished, as indicators registered increased heat from the friction of the freighter&#x2019;s dive. Between watching sensors and looking through the canopy, Han quickly found his first landmark, a volcanically active crevasse that ran on an east-west axis, like a stupendous, burning scar on the flesh of Duroon. He brought the Falcon out of her swoop, her control systems rebelling against the immense strain. He leveled off only meters above the planet&#x2019;s surface.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see them track us now,&#x201d; he said, self-satisfied. Chewbacca snorted. The meaning of the snort was clear&#x2014;this was temporary cover only. There was little danger of being detected either optically or by instrument over this seam in Duroon&#x2019;s surface, for the Falcon would be lost against a background of ferrous slag, infernal heat, and radioactive discord. But neither could she remain there for long.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the vivid orange light of the fissure that illuminated the cockpit, Han conceded that fact. At best, he&#x2019;d broken trail so the Authority ship would be unable to spot the Falcon should the pursuer gain enough altitude to bring her back into sensor range. He poured on as much airspeed as he dared in an effort to keep Duroon&#x2019;s mass between himself and the vessel hunting him while he sought his landing site. He cursed the fact that there were no proper navigational beacons; this was seat-of-the-pants flying, and no chance of leaning out the cockpit and stopping a passerby for directions.<br> &nbsp;<br> In minutes the ship had neared the western end of the fissure. Han was compelled to dump some velocity; it was time to look for road signs. He reviewed the instructions given him, instructions he&#x2019;d committed to memory alone. Off to the south a gigantic mountain range loomed. He banked the Falcon sharply to port, slapped a pair of switches, and bore straight for the mountains.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ship&#x2019;s special Terrain Following Sensors came on. Han kept the freighter&#x2019;s bow close above a surface of cooled lava and occasional active rifts, minor offspring of the great fissure. For whatever small edge it might give against detection, he trimmed the Falcon off at virtual landing altitude, screaming over eddied volcanic flatlands. &#x201c;Anybody down there better duck,&#x201d; he advised, keeping one eye pinned to the Terrain Following Sensors. They bleeped, having located the mountain pass for which he&#x2019;d been searching. He adjusted course.<br> &nbsp;<br> Funny. His information said the break in the mountains was plenty wide for the Falcon, but it looked mighty narrow on the TFS. For a second he debated going for altitude fast, hurdling the high peaks, but that just might put him back onto the Authority&#x2019;s scopes. He was too close to his delivery point, and a payday, to risk having to cut and run. The moment of option passed. He shed more airspeed, committed now to taking the pass at low level.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sweat collected on his forehead and dampened his shirt and vest. Chewbacca uttered his low rumble of utmost concentration as both partners synched to the running of the Millennium Falcon. The image of the pass on the TFS grew no more encouraging.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han tightened his grip on the controls, feeling the press of his flying gloves against them. &#x201c;Pass, nothing&#x2014;that thing&#x2019;s a slot! Hold your breath, Chewie; we&#x2019;ll have to skin through.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He threw himself into a grim battle with his ship. Chewbacca caterwauled his dislike for all unconventional maneuvers as he cut in braking thrusters, but even those would not be enough to avert disaster. The slot began to take on shape, a slightly lighter area of sky lit by bright stars and one of Duroon&#x2019;s three moons, set off by the silhouette of the mountains. It was, just barely, too narrow.<br> &nbsp;<br> The starship took some altitude, and her speed slackened. Those extra seconds gave Han time to pilot for his life, calling on razor-edge reflexes and instinctive skills that had seen him through scrapes all across the galaxy. He killed all shields, since they&#x2019;d have struck rock and overloaded, and wrenched his controls, standing the Millennium Falcon on her port-side. Sheer crags closed in on either side, so that the roar of the freighter&#x2019;s engines rebounded from the cliffs. He made minute corrections, staring at rock walls that seemed to be coming at him through the canopy, and rattled off a string of expletives having nothing whatsoever to do with piloting.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a slight jar, and the shriek of metal torn away as easily as paper. The long-range sensors winked out; the dish had been ripped off the upper hull by a protrusion of rock. Then the needle&#x2019;s eye was threaded sideways, and the Falcon was through the mountains.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perspiration beading his face, dampening his light brown hair, Han pounded Chewbacca. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d I tell you? Inspiration&#x2019;s my specialty!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The starship soared over the thick jungle that began beyond the mountains. Han leveled off, wiping a gloved hand across his brow. Chewbacca emitted a sustained growl. &#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; Han replied soberly in the wake of his elation. &#x201c;That was a stupid place to put a mountain.&#x201d; He took up scanning for the next landmark and spied it almost at once: a winding river. The Falcon skimmed in low over the watery coils as the Wookiee lowered the ship&#x2019;s landing gear.<br> &nbsp;<br> In seconds they&#x2019;d reached the landing area near a spectacular waterfall that dropped two hundred meters to the river in a flume like a blue-white, ghostly scrim under stars and moonlight. Han, reading the TFS, found a clearing in the heavy cover of vegetation and settled the ship slowly. The broad disks of the landing gear sank a bit in soft humus; then the hydrolics sighed briefly as the Millennium Falcon made herself comfortable.</p><h2>Fun Loving You: Enjoying Your Marriage in the Midst of the Grind</h2><p><b>For a Good Time, Call Home</b><b>&nbsp;</b>Ted Cunningham has a surprising definition of marriage: a man and a woman <i>enjoying </i>life together.

Common violence like rape, forced labor, illegal detention, land theft, and police abuse has become routine and relentless. And like a horde of locusts devouring everything in its path, the unchecked plague of violence ruins lives, blocks the road out of poverty, and undercuts development. How has this plague of violence grown so ferocious? In one of the most remarkable social disasters of the last half century, basic public justice systems in the developing world have descended into a state of utter collapse, and there's nothing shielding the poor from violent people.<br><br>Gary A. Haugen and Victor Boutros offer a searing account of how we got here and what it will take to end the plague. The Locust Effect is a gripping journey into the streets and slums where fear is a daily reality for billions of the world's<br>poorest, where safety is secured only for those with money, and where much of our well-intended aid is lost in the daily chaos of violence. While their call to action is urgent, Haugen and Boutros provide hope, a real solution and an ambitious way forward. The Locust Effect will forever change the way we understand global poverty,<br>and will help secure a safe path to prosperity for the global poor in the 21st century.<br></p><p><p><b> A Look Inside: <i>The Locust Effect</i> [Click Images to Enlarge]</b></p><br><strong>Gary A.

Expository Listening is your handbook on biblical listening. It is designed to equip you not only to understand what true, biblical preaching sounds like, but also how to receive it, and ultimately, what to do about it.

Originally from Memphis, Dickey now lives on the road and rests in whatever hotel will have him.</p>*Starred Review* Gideon took his name from the hollowed-out Bible the preacher was holding when Gideon killed him. Assassin Gideon's goal is to make a million dollars so he can retire, and until then no contract is too distasteful. Bruno is also a hit man, one beset with domestic worries, and he is on a surefire collision course heading straight to Gideon. Suspenseful right up to the cliff-hanger ending, gritty, graphic, and often gory, best-selling Dickey's latest high-tension tale is a serendipitous mix of lust, longing, and murder. Quirky details and observations pepper the pages and pop up in conversations--"Miss Universe was from Lobatse, Botswana"; "Takes two days to drive across Texas." And the pacing is amazing; action scenes are often broken down into rapid-fire one-sentence paragraphs, and the essence of each character is captured in a few brief sentences. Not only will Dickey's many readers be thrilled to see a new novel, this one is also sure to create new fans.

This is his first book.<b>THE REALMS OF THE HEAD, HEART, AND HANDS </b><br><br>The easiest thing you can do to have more productive disagree�ments immediately is to remember to ask the other person: &#x201c;Is this about what&#x2019;s true, what&#x2019;s meaningful, or what&#x2019;s useful?&#x201d; Is this about the head, the heart, or the hands? If you can agree on the answer, then you&#x2019;re on your way.<br><br>When we&#x2019;re having a disagreement with someone, it&#x2019;s really useful to pay attention to which of the three realms we&#x2019;re experiencing. The three realms are: anxiety about <i>what is true </i>(the head realm of information and science), anxiety about <i>what is meaningful </i>(the heart realm of preferences and values), and anxiety about <i>what is useful </i>(the hands realm of practicality and planning). Each of them represents a part of reality that has its own rules for validation and different implications in a conversation. What works to resolve a disagreement in one realm will not work in the other two.<br> <b><i><br>Head realm: what is true?</i></b><br> When a disagreement can be settled with information, we will call it a conflict of head, because it&#x2019;s about data and evidence that can be objectively verified as true or false out in the world. It is often concerned with the &#x201c;what&#x201d; of a situation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Example: Two people have an argument about who gets to spend more time watching shows that they like versus shows that the other person likes. The resolution to this disagreement is mea�sured in hours, with some bias toward recent days.<br> <b><i><br>Heart realm: what is meaningful? </i></b><br> When a disagreement can be settled only as a matter of personal taste, we&#x2019;ll call it a conflict of heart, because it&#x2019;s about preferences and values and judgment calls that can be determined only within oneself. It is often concerned with the &#x201c;why&#x201d; of a situation. <br><br> Example: Two people have an argument about whether a partic�ular show is worth watching. The resolution to this disagreement is measured by personal taste, ability to relate, appreciation for dif�ferent kinds of narratives.<br> <b><i><br>Hands realm: what is useful? </i></b><br> When a disagreement can only be settled with some form of test, or by waiting to see how things play out in the future, we&#x2019;ll call that a conflict of hands. It is often concerned with the &#x201c;how&#x201d; of a situation. <br><br>Example: Two people have an argument about the best way to balance TV time that takes into consideration differences in prefer�ences, differences in show schedules, and differences in personal schedules to be agreeable to both parties. The resolution to this dis�agreement is measured by its utility in the relationship over time.<br> <b><i><br>What if it&#x2019;s all of the above? </i></b><br>Disagreements always have at least one of these conflicts going on, but some will have a blend of two or all three. When that happens, asking &#x201c;What is this about?&#x201d; can help us separate these different arguments and then agree on which one should be addressed first.</p><h2>Predicting the Markets: A Professional Autobiography</h2><p><p><strong>In <em>Predicting the Markets</em>, Edward Yardeni, Wall Street&#x2019;s legendary economist and investment strategist, shares his insights and lessons learned forecasting the economy and financial markets over the past 40 years.</strong></p> <p>Ed Yardeni takes readers on a fascinating journey retracing the economic and financial ups and downs from the late 1970s through today. Along the way, he mines the lessons of the past for insights that inform how to be thinking about the future.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dr. Ed&#x201d; was among the first Wall Street prognosticators to see the bullish consequences of disinflation and globalization for stocks and bonds during the 1980s and 1990s. He was the first economist on Wall Street to recognize the importance of Baby Boom demographic trends. In 1993, he started writing about the &#x201c;High-Tech Revolution in the US of @&#x201d;&#x2014;presaging the enormous impact that technological advances would have on life today. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, he foresaw the resulting commodity boom. Dr. Ed turned bearish on financial services stocks during June 2007 before the financial crisis hit with full force. Although he wasn&#x2019;t bearish enough on the overall stock market back then, he correctly called the market&#x2019;s bottom the week after it was hit in March 2009, remaining steadfastly bullish during the nine-year bull run through the start of 2018.</p> <p>In <em>Predicting the Markets</em>, Dr. Ed explains his reasoning behind all these predictions. He also explores why so many conventional forecasting models have been so frequently wrong. His approach is based on common sense rather than complicated and often misguided theories. He demystifies what can often seem like a complex tangle of countervailing forces impacting financial markets and provides a highly engaging how-to guidebook for profiting from outside-the-box thinking, while avoiding the groupthink of consensus forecasting. Yet Dr. Ed&#x2019;s book can be read by anyone with an interest in financial markets and economics; no prior knowledge is necessary. All the major issues that investors must sort through as they navigate financial markets are explained in a clear and logical way.</p> <p>Dr. Ed believes everyone can benefit from a better understanding of the forces that shape our financial lives. Accordingly, <em>Predicting the Markets</em> is chock-full of important lessons not only for institutional investors but also for individual investors, as well as business professionals and students. When it comes to predicting the global economy and financial markets, Dr. Ed has literally written the book.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Ed Yardeni is the President of Yardeni Research, Inc., a provider of global investment strategy and asset allocation analyses and recommendations. He previously served as Chief Investment Strategist of Oak Associates, Prudential Equity Group, and Deutsche Bank's US equities division in New York City. He was also the Chief Economist of CJ Lawrence, Prudential-Bache Securities, and EF Hutton. He taught at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business and was an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He also held positions at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the US Treasury Department in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>Dr. Ed earned his PhD in economics from Yale University in 1976, having completed his doctoral dissertation under Nobel Laureate James Tobin. Previously, he received a master's degree in international relations from Yale. He completed his undergraduate studies magna cum laude at Cornell University.</p> <p>Dr. Ed is frequently quoted in the financial press, including The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, The New York Times, and Barron's. He was dubbed Wall Street Seer in a Barron's cover story. He appears frequently on CNBC and Bloomberg Television. See Dr. Ed's Media Center: media.yardeni.com</p>This book is a must-read. What could be a trudge through hundreds of pages of dense economic explanation becomes an entertaining education when intertwined with the life story of one of Wall Street s greatest investment strategists. --<i>Fred Fraenkel, Vice Chairman, Cowen Inc.</i><br><br>Imagine that your favorite uncle is a legend on Wall Street and agrees to share with you everything he has learned.

But this rebel queen with the cheeky grin was also a latter-day pop artist with a wickedly perceptive gift for satirizing the world around her&#x2014;her playful aesthetic sharply at odds with the stark monochrome style and nihilism of punk.

From growing up mixed-race in Brixton in the 1960s to being at the forefront of the emerging punk scene with X-Ray Spex in the 1970s, from finding faith with the Hare Krishna movement to balancing single motherhood with a solo music career and often debilitating mental health issues, the book openly explores Poly's exceptional life, up until her untimely passing in 2011.

Are all the stories of the Bible true? What about all the books that got left out? What do we make of all that violence? What do we do when biblical authors seem to disagree? And what if we encounter situations the Bible doesn&#x2019;t address? Drawing from the best of contemporary biblical scholarship and the ancient well of Christian tradition, scholar and preacher Meghan Larissa Good helps readers consider why the Bible matters. Known for presenting complex theological ideas in accessible, engaging ways, Good delves into issues like biblical authority, literary genre, and Christ-centered hermeneutics, and calls readers beyond either knee-jerk biblicism, on the one hand, or skeptical disregard on the other. Instead, <i>The Bible Unwrapped</i> invites readers to faithful reading, communal discernment, and deep and transformative wonder about Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Join an honest conversation about the Bible that is spiritually alive and intellectually credible.

An amusement park. David Harwood is glad to be spending some quality time with his wife and their four-year-old son. But what begins as a pleasant family outing turns into a nightmare after an inexplicable disappearance. A frantic search only leads to an even more shocking and harrowing turn of events. Until this terrifying moment, David Harwood is just a small-town reporter in need of a break. Now the only thing he cares about is restoring his family. Desperate for any clue, David dives into his own investigation&#x2014;and into a web of lies and deceit.

Journalist David Harwood is left only with questions after a family outing becomes a terrifying nightmare in the mere blink of an eye. Someone, it would seem, is out to get him, and when suspicious evidence labels him a &#x201c;person of interest&#x201d; in a mysterious disappearance, the unassuming Harwood is forced to bare his teeth in pursuit of the truth. Fans of <i>Fear the Worst</i>, <i>Too Close to Home</i>, and <i>No Time for Goodbye</i> should already know the drill: Barclay refuses to grant readers any respite with gut-wrenching plot twists that keep firing until the final page. But those unfamiliar with his work would be wise to clear their calendars for this engaging non-stop thriller. --<i>Dave Callanan</i> <br><br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Linwood Barclay on <i>Never Look Away</i></strong> <br> <p> </p><p>Years ago, when I worked on the city desk for <i>The Toronto Star</i>, every once in a while someone would phone in with a hot tip. Something they&#x2019;d heard from a friend of a friend. The story was that children were being spirited away from a local theme park. Grabbed, disguised, thrown into a van and driven away so fast their parents hadn&#x2019;t even noticed they were gone yet.</p> <p>And the kicker was, the story was being suppressed because the theme park owners didn&#x2019;t want bad publicity.</p> <p>There was never, ever anything to it. I&#x2019;d worked in the news business long enough to know that when a kid goes missing. That story gets out. Big time.</p> <p>Our theme park was not the only one where this urban myth played out. I&#x2019;d heard the same story about a number of big attractions. But never with any real names attached. It always happened to the boyfriend of someone&#x2019;s cousin&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s boss.</p> <p>But the story stayed with me just the same. I started playing around with it in my head. I thought, okay, let&#x2019;s start with the myth, but then let&#x2019;s do something entirely different. Someone&#x2019;s going to disappear, all right, but not the person you&#x2019;re expecting...</p> <p>As I began working out the storyline for my new thriller, <i>Never Look Away</i>, the amusement park scene became a way in to a very different kind of tale for me. One about secrets, about past, hidden lives, about how sometimes the people we&#x2019;re closest to are the ones we know the least. One significant way in which it differs from my previous novels is that it is not told entirely in first person. This time, there were things I had to keep from my protagonist that the reader just had to know.</p> <p>That time on the city desk was part of more than 30 years I spent working in newspapers. It was a period in which papers mattered a great deal. They still do, but it&#x2019;s hardly news to point out they&#x2019;re facing tough times, a perfect storm of changing technology meeting harsh economic realities. So when it came to deciding what that protagonist would do for a living, I decided to make him a reporter at a small daily that&#x2019;s more concerned with maintaining revenues than breaking scandals, especially if breaking them will hurt the bottom line. (I like to point out, I never encountered anything like that at <i>The Star</i>.)</p> <p>I was well into writing this novel when Michael Connelly&#x2019;s terrific novel <i>The Scarecrow</i> came out, which is also set against the backdrop of a newspaper in decline. I suspect these will not be the only two novels to explore--either in depth or in a tangential way--the significant changes this institution is going through. </p> <p>Another urban myth that used to get called into the paper now and again was that some unscrupulous developer was building houses so cheaply, someone&#x2019;s piano went right through the living room floor. We never found that house, but there might still be a murder mystery in that story, especially if there was some poor bastard in that basement. <em>--Linwood Barclay</em></p><b>Linwood Barclay</b>&nbsp;is a former columnist for the&nbsp;<i>Toronto Star</i>.

If you want to know how you can help create a better world, read this book.</strong></p><p>What if there were a way to prevent criminal behavior, mental illness, drug abuse, poverty, and violence? Written by behavioral scientist Tony Biglan, and based on his ongoing research at the Oregon Research Institute, <em>The Nurture Effect </em>offers evidence-based interventions that can prevent many of the psychological and behavioral problems that plague our society.</p><p>For decades, behavioral scientists have investigated the role our environment plays in shaping who we are, and their research shows that we now have the power within our own hands to reduce violence, improve cognitive development in our children, increase levels of education and income, and even prevent future criminal behaviors. By cultivating a positive environment in all aspects of society&#x2015;from the home, to the classroom, and beyond&#x2015;we can ensure that young people arrive at adulthood with the skills, interests, assets, and habits needed to live healthy, happy, and productive lives.</p><p><em>The Nurture Effect</em> details over forty years of research in the behavioral sciences, as well as the author&#x2019;s own research. Biglan illustrates how his findings lay the framework for a model of societal change that has the potential to reverberate through all environments within society.</p></p><p><strong>Anthony Biglan, PhD</strong>, is a senior scientist at Oregon Research Institute, and a leading figure in the development of prevention science. His research over the past thirty years has helped to identify effective family, school, and community interventions to prevent the most common and costly problems of childhood and adolescence.

Thought-provoking and inspirational, Biglan shares with us his wisdom and provides a compelling call to individuals, families, schools, communities, organizations, corporations, and policymakers to be part of creating nurturing environments.<em> The Nurture Effect</em> is a science-based prescription for creating a more health-enhancing society.&nbsp;Biglan concisely summarizes his hard-earned wisdom from a remarkable career as a clinician and scientist, his knowledge of diverse scientific fields, as well as his rich life experiences, including as husband, father, and grandfather. Transformative and practical, it provides a guide for the foundation of a more caring and health-promoting society.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kelli A. Komro, PhD</strong>, professor of health outcomes and policy at the College of Medicine, associate director of the Institute for Child Health Policy, and Research Foundation Professor at the University of Florida<br><br>&#x201c;Anthony Biglan&#x2019;s vast intelligence and scientific experience are brought together in <em>The Nurture Effect</em> to provide a vision, a road map, and a sense of optimism about solving the very real social problems facing our country. Evidence-based behavioral programs and policies provide the basis for Anthony&#x2019;s argument that greater attention to nurturing, as opposed to coercion&#x2015;at home, in schools, with peer groups, within communities, and even as public policy&#x2015;will lead to healthier and better-adjusted youth and adults. The book is critically important as we consider how we are raising the current and next generations, and can serve to guide discussions on next steps in science, policy, and practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Cheryl L. Perry, PhD</strong>, professor and regional dean at The University of Texas School of Public Health, Austin Regional Campus<br><br>&#x201c;Anthony Biglan&#x2019;s latest book <em>The Nurture Effect</em> is a powerful reminder of the transformational impact a nurturing environment has on individuals&#x2019; well-being throughout their lives. In documenting many carefully selected examples of evidence-based interventions from early childhood and through subsequent stages of development, it makes an outstanding contribution to the field of prevention science. Biglan makes a compelling case for widely implementing scientifically supported interventions that create nurturing environments in our homes, schools and communities. When individuals develop the social and emotional competencies they need to do well, their lives are permanently transformed. This book challenges policy makers, professionals, and the community at large to think well beyond individual benefit, and consider that behavioral science knowledge can apply to entire populations. I unreservedly endorse this excellent and timely contribution.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Matthew R.

The nurture effect impacts us daily in our health, intelligence, behavior, emotions, work, and relationships. The daily nurture effect even codes our gene expression&#x2015;something my scientific colleagues and I only began to suspect one or two decades ago, but have proof of now.&nbsp;This book maps how we can intentionally nurture ourselves, our loved ones, our communities, and even our nations. All of this is based on rigorous practical science. If you want to improve the now and better the future, read this book and apply the nurture effect at home, at work or at school, and in your community.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Dennis D. Embry, PhD</strong>, president and senior scientist at PAXIS Institute<br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Nurture Effect</em> is a remarkably ambitious book that draws the blueprints for creating prosocial communities aiming to help people live healthier, value-directed, and enjoyable lives. Biglan explains how people can work together to reduce suffering and improve quality of living for each other, and supports these plans with reliable behavioral research.&nbsp; The science of this book is captivating because Biglan expresses the ideas in an understandable and practical manner.&nbsp; In other words, he simplifies the science of human behavior so you can use it to improve your own community. <em>The Nurture Effect</em> hits the ground running with clear, concise, well-stated facts about creating a social context for people to experience a life well-lived. Throughout the book, Biglan expands these ideas into the different branches of community, such as family, schools, work, peer-relations, and discusses how&#x2015;when approached appropriately&#x2015;they can make lasting positive contributions to individuals. The perspectives you gain from this book will not only assist you in helping your community to become stronger and healthier, but will also help you as an individual to experience those same positive outcomes.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>D.J. Moran, PhD</strong>, founder of Pickslyde Consulting and the MidAmerican Psychological Institute<br><br><br>&#x201c;This marvelous book integrates the most compelling scientific knowledge about how we can improve the lives of citizens of this country with a bold call to action. Fundamentally, Anthony Biglan&#x2015;a gifted and experienced behavioral scientist&#x2015;challenges us to ask, &#x2018;What kind of society do we want? How can we use what we know to create such a society?&#x2019; His central thesis is that widely implementing what we have learned over decades in developing programs that nurture children, adolescents, parents and adults in families, in schools, and in the larger society&#x2015;which he calls a <em>revolution in behavioral science&#x2015;</em>will make a huge difference.<br>&nbsp;<br>The book contains highly practical, specific recommendations for families, practitioners, and policy makers. Biglan rightly recognizes that to significantly change society for the better, we must address larger social forces&#x2015;for example, the negative effects of poverty and economic inequality, or of marketing tobacco and alcohol to youth. Eminently readable, this book comprehensively reviews evidence based on a lifetime of experience as a social scientist, and knits it together with a compelling agenda, that if enacted, could lead to a significant, positive transformation of our country.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;William R. Beardslee, MD</strong>, director of the Baer Prevention Initiatives at Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital, and Gardner-Monks Professor of child psychiatry at Harvard Medical School<br><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Nurture Effect</em> is exciting because it is grounded in science but leads us well beyond the fragmented slivers in which scientific findings are often delivered.&nbsp; Anthony Biglan persuades us that rather than focusing on preventing individual problems of family dysfunction, drug addiction, academic failure, child abuse, and even crime, we need to cut to the chase and attend to what all of these have in common. Biglan shows that poverty consistently makes it harder to help, and that nurture is so frequently missing. By integrating findings from the past fifty years in psychology, epidemiology, education, and neuroscience, he pulls out the common threads to show that it is possible to make families, schools, and the larger social context more nurturing, and ultimately to create the nurturing environments so vital to well-being and to preventing widespread harm.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;Lisbeth B. Schorr</strong>, senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Social Policy, and coauthor of <em>Within Our Reach</em><br><br><br>&#x201c;This work is Anthony Biglan&#x2019;s magnum opus. He has pulled together many ideas from multiple disciplinary domains. It is required reading for anyone who is serious about fixing the problems in our education system and alleviating poverty. &nbsp;Anyone who liked David Brooks&#x2019; <em>The</em><em>Social Animal</em> will also like this. Although Biglan is a self-identified and proud behaviorist, this work shows his openness to other perspectives. I was especially happy to see his new nuanced view of the role of reinforcement in human behavior (pages 28-29).

Only then do they ask the question, &#34;why didn&#39;t anyone ever tell me that?&#34; Well, Mom is telling you now, along with thousands of other people that are simply seeking some foundational knowledge about money. Most people did not grow up with positive financial role models in their lives and were never adequately educated about money--not at home, not in school, and not even in college. So here is your &#34;textbook&#34; on money matters that will raise your financial IQ. The help that you will get in this book will give you the power to make better financial decisions. Take a peek at the self-taught wisdom of this mother as she speaks to her daughter through her smart, no-nonsense Money Letters.</p><p>My motivation for writing this book:<br><br>My dad raised six hard-headed kids in a small three-bedroom ranch home, in a small rural town, on a factory laborer's income. But he did it and never complained. He was proud and&nbsp;never asked anybody for anything. Sometimes I hated that because we had little or nothing of our own--no phone, no new clothes, and every Thursday before payday, an empty refrigerator. I truly don't know how he did it, but looking back, I so admire and respect how he lived and showed me how to live--with values, honesty, and pride, regardless of our place in life.<br><br>In 1988, when I was a senior at Silver Bluff High School, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, which took its toll in a matter of months. He died at the age of forty-nine. My dad never got to see me graduate from high school, go on to college, start my own family, or write this book.<br><br>I used to say that no one helped me with anything when I was paying my own way through college, but while writing this book, I realized, my father helped me the whole time. He helped me by teaching me how to stand on my own two feet and not expect&nbsp;anything from anybody. So I did, without pause, because that's just what I was taught.<br><br>Still, I despised the financial deficit we seemed to always be in growing up. I was too young to really understand why money was always so tight, but I vowed not to be in that same place after I became an adult and had my own children. I think that was a big part of the drive behind all the money decisions I've made--getting a college degree, paying off debts quickly, saving aggressively so I would always have something to fall back on, investing my money wisely, and striving just to be a proud member of the middle class.<br><br>After doing what I thought was a pretty good job of this (and still trying), I of course, wanted to pass my wisdom on to my daughter. Problem was, she didn't want to listen to anything I had to say once she hit fifteen.&nbsp;Since she wouldn't listen to me, I decided to teach her all my life lessons and advice about money,&nbsp;in writing!&nbsp;Oh, and while doing that, I figured I would share what I had to say to her, with every man, woman, and child that was never taught the basics about money and personal finances, like me.&nbsp;<br><br>Through my writings, I realized that this was my calling and the way in which I shall give back to society. My one-sentence soapbox is:&nbsp;Most people know very little about money, and there is a desperate need for better financial literacy in the United States, starting with high school on through college and beyond.<br><br>To stay true to myself, my daughter, and anyone else curious enough to take a moment to read what I have to say, I wrote this book with unyielding frankness. I gathered all my experience, knowledge, successes, and failures with money--coupled with more hours of research and study than it would take you to earn a four-year college degree--in order to give you&nbsp;Money Letters 2 my Daughter.In&nbsp;Money Letters 2 my Daughter, mother and author Jackie Cummings Koski shares her self-taught wisdom through a series of letters to her daughter about all things dealing with personal&nbsp;finances.

It does when the novel is as inventive and beautiful as this one by Anthony Doerr. In fact, <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em>--while set mostly in Germany and France before and during the war--is not really a &#x201c;war novel&#x201d;. Yes, there is fear and fighting and disappearance and death, but the author&#x2019;s focus is on the interior lives of his two characters. Marie Laure is a blind 14-year-old French girl who flees to the countryside when her father disappears from Nazi-occupied Paris. Werner is a gadget-obsessed German orphan whose skills admit him to a brutal branch of Hitler Youth. Never mind that their paths don&#x2019;t cross until very late in the novel, this is not a book you read for plot (although there is a wonderful, mysterious subplot about a stolen gem). This is a book you read for the beauty of Doerr&#x2019;s writing-- &#x201c;Abyss in her gut, desert in her throat, Marie-Laure takes one of the cans of food...&#x201d;--and for the way he understands and cherishes the magical obsessions of childhood. Marie Laure and Werner are never quaint or twee. Instead they are powerful examples of the way average people in trying times must decide daily between morality and survival. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Anthony Doerr is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>.

Mei-Ling Hopgood, a first-time mom from suburban Michigan-now living in Buenos Aires-was shocked that Argentine parents allow their children to stay up until all hours of the night. Could there really be social and developmental advantages to this custom? Driven by a journalist&#39;s curiosity and a new mother&#39;s desperation for answers, Hopgood embarked on a journey to learn how other cultures approach the challenges all parents face: bedtimes, potty training, feeding, teaching, and more. Observing parents around the globe and interviewing anthropologists, educators, and child-care experts, she discovered a world of new ideas. The Chinese excel at potty training, teaching their wee ones as young as six months old. Kenyans wear their babies in colorful cloth slings-not only is it part of their cultural heritage, but strollers seem outright silly on Nairobi&#39;s chaotic sidewalks. And the French are experts at turning their babies into healthy, adventurous eaters. Hopgood tested her discoveries on her spirited toddler, Sofia, with some enlightening results. This intimate and surprising look at the ways other cultures raise children offers parents the option of experimenting with tried and true methods from around the world and shows that there are many ways to be a good parent.</p><p>Mei-Ling Hopgood is an award-winning journalist and writer. She lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with her husband and two daughters. Find her online at www.meilinghopgood.com.<br>"The book is breezy and entertaining and Hopgood is charmingly self-deprecating about her own mothering of the formidable Sofia, who emerges as a sassy character in her own right."&#x2014;<strong>Boston Globe</strong><br><br>"A pleasure to read . . . No doubt some details will be too enticing not to try, like recruiting the whole family for meal preparation and training young children to take responsibility for simple tasks. Ultimately, this absorbing assemblage of perspectives will help widen our own." &#x2014;<strong>BookPage</strong><br><br>"Throughout her carefully organized text, [Hopgood] shows enormous respect for everyone she speaks with and everything she learns...

Most Christians think the obvious answer to this question is, &#34;Yes, of course he does!&#34; Indeed, many Christians would agree that the very heart of the gospel is that God so loved the whole world that he gave his Son to make salvation available for every single person. This book shows that one of the most popular and resurgent theological movements in the contemporary evangelical church--namely, Calvinism--cannot coherently and consistently affirm this vital claim about the love of God. While some Calvinists forthrightly deny that God loves everyone, more commonly Calvinists attempt to affirm the love of God for all persons in terms that are compatible with their doctrines that Christ died only for the elect--those persons God has unconditionally chosen to save. This book shows that the Calvinist attempts to affirm God&#39;s love for all persons are fraught with severe philosophical and theological difficulties. Calvinism, then, should be rejected in favor a theology that can forthrightly and consistently affirm the love of God for all persons. Nothing less is at stake than the very heart of the gospel.</p><p>Jerry L. Walls is Scholar in Residence and Professor of Philosophy at Houston Baptist University.

She is a professor at Brooklyn College and lives in New York City.1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>She shouldn&#x2019;t have been tempted. <br>This is what Kestrel thought as she swept the sailors&#x2019; silver off the impromptu gaming table set up in a corner of the market. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; said one sailor. <br>&#x201c;Stay,&#x201d; said another, but Kestrel cinched her wrist-strap velvet purse shut. The sun had lowered, and caramelized the color of things, which meant that she had played cards long enough to be noticed by someone who mattered. <br>Someone who would tell her father. <br>Cards wasn&#x2019;t even her favorite game. The silver wouldn&#x2019;t begin to pay for her silk dress, snagged from the splintery crate she had used as a stool. But sailors were much better adversaries than the average aristocrat. They flipped cards with feral tricks, swore when they lost, swore when they won, would gouge the last silver keystone coin out of a friend. And they cheated. Kestrel especially liked it when they cheated. It made beating them not quite so easy. <br>She smiled and left them. Then her smile faded. This hour of thrilling risk was going to cost her. It wasn&#x2019;t the gambling that would infuriate her father, or the company she had kept. No, General Trajan was going to want to know why his daughter was in the city market alone. <br>Other people wondered, too. She saw it in their eyes as she threaded through market stalls offering open sacks of spice, the scents mingling with salty air that wafted from the nearby port. Kestrel guessed the words people didn&#x2019;t dare whisper as she passed. Of course they didn&#x2019;t speak. They knew who she was. And she knew what they would say. <br>Where was Lady Kestrel&#x2019;s escort? <br>And if she had no friend or family available to escort her to the market, where was her slave? <br>Well, as for a slave, they had been left at her villa. Kestrel did not need them. <br>As for the whereabouts of her escort, she was wondering the same thing. <br>Jess had wandered off to look at the wares. Kestrel last saw her weaving like a flower-drunk bee through the stalls, her pale blond hair almost white in the summer sun. Technically, Jess could get in as much trouble as Kestrel. It wasn&#x2019;t allowed for a young Valorian girl who wasn&#x2019;t a member of the military to walk alone. But Jess&#x2019;s parents doted on her, and they hardly had the same notion of discipline as the highest-ranking general in the Valorian army. <br>Kestrel scanned the stalls for her friend, and finally caught the gleam of blond braids styled in the latest fashion. Jess was talking to a jewelry seller who dangled a pair of earrings. The translucent gold droplets caught the light. <br>Kestrel drew closer. <br>&#x201c;Topaz,&#x201d; the elderly woman was saying to Jess. &#x201c;To brighten your lovely brown eyes. Only ten keystones.&#x201d; <br>There was a hard set to the jewelry seller&#x2019;s mouth. Kestrel met the woman&#x2019;s gray eyes and noticed that her wrinkled skin was browned from years of working outdoors. She was Herrani, but a brand on her wrist proved that she was free. Kestrel wondered how she had earned that freedom. Slaves freed by their masters were rare. <br>Jess glanced up. &#x201c;Oh, Kestrel,&#x201d; she breathed. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t these earrings perfect?&#x201d; <br>Maybe if the weight of silver in Kestrel&#x2019;s purse hadn&#x2019;t dragged at her wrist she would have said nothing. Maybe if that drag at her wrist hadn&#x2019;t also dragged at her heart with dread, Kestrel would have thought before she spoke. But instead she blurted what was the obvious truth. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not topaz. They&#x2019;re glass.&#x201d; <br>There was a sudden bubble of silence. It expanded, grew thin and sheer. People around them were listening. The earrings trembled in midair. <br>Because the jewelry seller&#x2019;s bony fingers were trembling. <br>Because Kestrel had just accused her of trying to cheat a Valorian. <br>And what would happen next? What would happen to any Herrani in this woman&#x2019;s position? What would the crowd witness? <br>An officer of the city guard called to the scene. A plea of innocence, ignored. Old hands bound to the whipping post. Lashes until blood darkened the market dirt. <br>&#x201c;Let me see,&#x201d; Kestrel said, her voice imperious, because she was very good at being imperious. She reached for the earrings and pretended to examine them. &#x201c;Ah. It seems I was mistaken. Indeed they <i>are</i> topaz.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Take them,&#x201d; whispered the jewelry seller. <br>&#x201c;We are not poor. We have no need of a gift from someone such as you.&#x201d; Kestrel set coins on the woman&#x2019;s table. The bubble of silence broke, and shoppers returned to discussing whatever ware had caught their fancy. <br>Kestrel gave the earrings to Jess and led her away. <br>As they walked, Jess studied one earring, letting it swing like a tiny bell. &#x201c;So they <i>are</i> real?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How can you tell?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re completely unclouded,&#x201d; Kestrel said. &#x201c;No flaws. Ten keystones was too cheap a price for topaz of that quality.&#x201d; <br>Jess might have commented that ten keystones was too great a price for glass. But she said only, &#x201c;The Herrani would say that the god of lies must love you, you see things so clearly.&#x201d; <br>Kestrel remembered the woman&#x2019;s stricken gray eyes. &#x201c;The Herrani tell too many stories.&#x201d; They had been dreamers. Her father always said that this was why they had been easy to conquer. <br>&#x201c;Everyone loves stories,&#x201d; Jess said. <br>Kestrel stopped to take the earrings from Jess and slip them into her friend&#x2019;s ears. &#x201c;Then wear these to the next society dinner. Tell everyone you paid an outrageous sum, and they will believe they&#x2019;re true jewels. Isn&#x2019;t that what stories do, make real things fake, and fake things real?&#x201d; <br>Jess smiled, turning her head from side to side so that the earrings glittered. &#x201c;Well? Am I beautiful?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Silly. You know you are.&#x201d; <br>Jess led the way now, slipping past a table with brass bowls holding powdered dye. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my turn to buy something for you,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;I have everything I need.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You sound like an old woman! One would think you&#x2019;re seventy, not seventeen.&#x201d; <br>The crowd was thicker now, filled with the golden features of Valorians, hair and skin and eyes ranging from honey tones to light brown. The occasional dark heads belonged to well-dressed house slaves, who had come with their masters and stayed close to their sides. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look so troubled,&#x201d; Jess said. &#x201c;Come, I will find something to make you happy. A bracelet?&#x201d; <br>But that reminded Kestrel of the jewelry seller. &#x201c;We should go home.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sheet music?&#x201d; <br>Kestrel hesitated. <br>&#x201c;Aha,&#x201d; said Jess. She seized Kestrel&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let go.&#x201d; <br>This was an old game. Kestrel closed her eyes and was tugged blindly after Jess, who laughed, and then Kestrel laughed, too, as she had years ago when they first met. <br>The general had been impatient with his daughter&#x2019;s mourning. &#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s been dead half a year,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;That is long enough.&#x201d; Finally, he had had a senator in a nearby villa bring his daughter, also eight years old, to visit. The men went inside Kestrel&#x2019;s house. The girls were told to stay outside. &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; the general had ordered. <br>Jess had chattered at Kestrel, who ignored her. Finally, Jess stopped. &#x201c;Close your eyes,&#x201d; she said. <br>Curious, Kestrel did. <br>Jess had grabbed her hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let go!&#x201d; They tore over the general&#x2019;s grassy grounds, slipping and tumbling and laughing. <br>It was like that now, except for the press of people around them. <br>Jess slowed. Then she stopped and said, &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; <br>Kestrel opened her eyes. <br>The girls had come to a waist-high wooden barrier that overlooked a pit below. &#x201c;You brought me <i>here</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to,&#x201d; said Jess. &#x201c;I got distracted by a woman&#x2019;s hat&#x2014;did <i>you</i> know hats are in fashion?&#x2014;and was following to get a better look, and&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And brought us to the slave market.&#x201d; The crowd had congealed behind them, noisy with restless anticipation. There would be an auction soon. <br>Kestrel stepped back. She heard a smothered oath when her heel met someone&#x2019;s toes. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never get out now,&#x201d; Jess said. &#x201c;We might as well stay until the auction&#x2019;s over.&#x201d; <br>Hundreds of Valorians were gathered before the barrier, which curved in a wide semicircle. Everyone in the crowd was dressed in silks, each with a dagger strapped to the hip, though some&#x2014;like Jess&#x2014;wore it more as an ornamental toy than a weapon. <br>The pit below was empty, save for a large wooden auction block. <br>&#x201c;At least we have a good view.&#x201d; Jess shrugged. <br>Kestrel knew that Jess understood why her friend had claimed loudly that the glass earrings were topaz. Jess understood why they had been purchased. But the girl&#x2019;s shrug reminded Kestrel that there were certain things they couldn&#x2019;t discuss. <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said a pointy-chinned woman at Kestrel&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;At last.&#x201d; Her eyes narrowed on the pit and the stocky man walking into its center. He was Herrani, with the typical black hair, though his skin was pale from an easy life, no doubt due to the same favoritism that had gotten him this job. This was someone who had learned how to please his Valorian conquerors. <br>The auctioneer stood in front of the block. <br>&#x201c;Show us a girl first,&#x201d; called the woman at Kestrel&#x2019;s side, her voice both loud and languid. <br>Many voices were shouting now, each calling for what they wanted to see. Kestrel found it hard to breathe. <br>&#x201c;A girl!&#x201d; yelled the pointy-chinned woman, this time more loudly. <br>The auctioneer, who had been sweeping his hands toward him as if gathering the cries and excitement, paused when the woman&#x2019;s shout cut through the noise. He glanced at her, then at Kestrel. A flicker of surprise seemed to show on his face. She thought that she must have imagined it, for he skipped on to Jess, then peered in a full semicircle at all the Valorians against the barrier above and around him. <br>He raised a hand. Silence fell. &#x201c;I have something very special for you.&#x201d; <br>The acoustics of the pit were made to carry a whisper, and the auctioneer knew his trade. His soft voice made everyone lean closer. <br>His hand shifted to beckon toward the open, yet roofed and shadowed structure built low and small at the back of the pit. He twitched his fingers once, then twice, and something stirred in the holding pen. <br>A young man stepped out. <br>The crowd murmured. Bewilderment grew as the slave slowly paced across the yellow sand. He stepped onto the auction block. <br>This was nothing special. <br>&#x201c;Nineteen years old, and in fine condition.&#x201d; The auctioneer clapped the slave on the back. &#x201c;This one,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;would be perfect for the house.&#x201d; <br>Laughter rushed through the crowd. Valorians nudged each other and praised the auctioneer. He knew how to entertain. <br>The slave was bad goods. He looked, Kestrel thought, like a brute. A deep bruise on the slave&#x2019;s cheek was evidence of a fight and a promise that he would be difficult to control. His bare arms were muscular, which likely only confirmed the crowd&#x2019;s belief that he would be best working for someone with a whip in hand. Perhaps in another life he could have been groomed for a house; his hair was brown, light enough to please some Valorians, and while his features couldn&#x2019;t be discerned from Kestrel&#x2019;s distance, there was a proud line in the way he stood. But his skin was bronzed from outdoor labor, and surely it was to such work that he would return. He might be purchased by someone who needed a dockworker or a builder of walls. <br>Yet the auctioneer kept up his joke. &#x201c;He could serve at your table.&#x201d; <br>More laughter. <br>&#x201c;Or be your valet.&#x201d; <br>Valorians held their sides and fluttered their fingers, begging the auctioneer to stop, stop, he was too funny. <br>&#x201c;I want to leave,&#x201d; Kestrel told Jess, who pretended not to hear. <br>&#x201c;All right, all right.&#x201d; The auctioneer grinned. &#x201c;The lad does have some real skills. On my honor,&#x201d; he added, laying a hand over his heart, and the crowd chuckled again, for it was common knowledge that there was no such thing as Herrani honor. &#x201c;This slave has been trained as a blacksmith. He would be perfect for any soldier, especially for an officer with a guard of his own and weapons to maintain.&#x201d; <br>There was a murmur of interest. Herrani blacksmiths were rare. If Kestrel&#x2019;s father were here, he would probably bid. His guard had long complained about the quality of the city blacksmith&#x2019;s work. <br>&#x201c;Shall we start the bidding?&#x201d; said the auctioneer. &#x201c;Five pilasters. Do I hear five bronze pilasters for the boy? Ladies and gentlemen, you could not <i>hire</i> a blacksmith for so little.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Five,&#x201d; someone called. <br>&#x201c;Six.&#x201d; <br>And the bidding began in earnest. <br>The bodies at Kestrel&#x2019;s back might as well have been stone. She couldn&#x2019;t move. She couldn&#x2019;t look at the expressions of her people. She couldn&#x2019;t catch the attention of Jess, or stare into the too-bright sky. These were all the reasons, she decided, why it was impossible to gaze anywhere else but at the slave. <br>&#x201c;Oh, come now,&#x201d; said the auctioneer. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s worth at least ten.&#x201d; <br>The slave&#x2019;s shoulders stiffened. The bidding continued. <br>Kestrel closed her eyes. When the price reached twenty-five pilasters, Jess said, &#x201c;Kestrel, are you ill?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll leave as soon as it&#x2019;s over. It won&#x2019;t be long now.&#x201d; <br>There was a lull in the bidding. It appeared the slave would go for twenty-five pilasters, a pitiful price, yet as much as anyone was willing to pay for a person who would soon be worked into uselessness. <br>&#x201c;My dear Valorians,&#x201d; said the auctioneer. &#x201c;I have forgotten one thing. Are you sure he wouldn&#x2019;t make a fine house slave? Because this lad can sing.&#x201d; <br>Kestrel opened her eyes. <br>&#x201c;Imagine music during dinner, how charmed your guests will be.&#x201d; The auctioneer glanced up at the slave, who stood tall on his block. &#x201c;Go on. Sing for them.&#x201d; <br>Only then did the slave shift position. It was a slight movement and quickly stilled, but Jess sucked in her breath as if she, like Kestrel, expected a fight to break out in the pit below. <br>The auctioneer hissed at the slave in rapid Herrani, too quietly for Kestrel to understand. <br>The slave answered in his language. His voice was low: &#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t know the acoustics of the pit. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t care, or worry that any Valorian knew at least enough Herrani to understand him. No matter. The auction was over now. No one would want him. Probably the person who had offered twenty-five pilasters was already regretting a bid for someone so intractable that he wouldn&#x2019;t obey even his own kind. <br>But his refusal touched Kestrel. The stony set of the slave&#x2019;s shoulders reminded her of herself, when her father demanded something that she couldn&#x2019;t give. <br>The auctioneer was furious. He should have closed the sale or at least made a show of asking for a higher price, but he simply stood there, fists at his sides, likely trying to figure out how he could punish the young man before passing him on to the misery of cutting rock, or the heat of the forge. <br>Kestrel&#x2019;s hand moved on its own. &#x201c;A keystone,&#x201d; she called. <br>The auctioneer turned. He sought the crowd. When he found Kestrel a smile sparked his expression into cunning delight. &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c; <i>there</i> is someone who knows worth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kestrel.&#x201d; Jess plucked at her sleeve. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; <br>The auctioneer&#x2019;s voice boomed: &#x201c;Going once, going twice&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Twelve keystones!&#x201d; called a man leaning against the barrier across from Kestrel, on the other side of its semicircle. <br>The auctioneer&#x2019;s jaw dropped. &#x201c;Twelve?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thirteen!&#x201d; came another cry. <br>Kestrel inwardly winced. If she had to bid anything&#x2014;and why, why had she?&#x2014;it shouldn&#x2019;t have been so high. Everyone thronged around the pit was looking at her: the general&#x2019;s daughter, a high society bird who flitted from one respectable house to the next. They thought&#x2014; <br>&#x201c;Fourteen!&#x201d; <br>They thought that...</p><h2>The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep</h2><p>Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep</p><p>With a mountain of student debts after six years of studying psychology and leadership at Swedish universities, and quite a few years helping companies and managers who think they know it all already, is Carl-Johan broad-sighted enough to inspire and awaken new thoughts about your personal development and see the world through new eyes. <br> <br> Carl-Johan is a curious and dedicated author who shares his thoughts with the world via books about leadership and personal development. Also via the really sleep-inducing bedtime story, <i> The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep. </i> <br>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Roger the Rabbit cannot fall asleep. His father has nodded off, as have his siblings. His mother suggests that she and Roger take a walk to visit Uncle Yawn, "who was the world's kindest wizard and who lived just on the other side of the meadow." Written with a specific language pattern based on psychological techniques, this rather verbose picture book offers harried and desperate parents the promise of a magical story that will soothe their children to sleep, while offering relaxation and mindfulness techniques to help children take control of their thoughts and prepare for slumber. The artwork is mediocre and does not enhance the text. But according to the author's note in the front of the book, the artwork matters little; Ehrlin tells parents that "it is best if the child is lying down while listening, instead of looking at the pictures, so that he or she can relax even more." Ultimately, the book is instructional and didactic, specifically written for children who experience great difficulty winding down at the end of the day. VERDICT Most people should stick with the bedtime classics that soothe and calm, such as Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon, Mem Fox's Time for Bed, or Peggy Rathman's Goodnight Gorilla.&#x2014;Lisa Kropp, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY</p><h2>Lonely Planet South Africa, Lesotho &amp; Swaziland (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s number one travel guide publisher* </i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet&#x2019;s <i>South Africa, Lesotho &amp; Swaziland&nbsp;</i></b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

It is a place where you may feel uncertain, empty, lost, tempted, and alone. Yet these feelings - these gifts of the Dark Wood - can be your greatest assets on your journey. According to the ancients, you don't need to be a saint or spiritual master to experience profound awakening. You don't even have to be "above average." All you really need to be is <i>struggling</i>.<br><br>In clear and lucid prose that combines the heart of a mystic, the soul of a poet, and the mind of a biblical scholar, Dr. Eric Elnes demystifies the seven gifts bestowed in the Dark Wood: the gifts of uncertainty, emptiness, being thunderstruck, getting lost, temptation, disappearing, and the gift of misfits.<br><br>This is a book for anyone who feels awkward in their search for God, who seeks to find holiness amid their holy mess, who prefers practicality to piety when it comes to finding their place in this world.</p><p>Eric Elnes (PhD, Princeton Theological Seminary) is a pastor, speaker, and media host. He is the author of <em>The Phoenix Affirmations: A New Vision for the Future of Christianity</em> and <em>Igniting Worship: The Seven Deadly Sins</em>. His book <em>Asphalt Jesus: Finding a New Christian Faith</em> <em>on the Highways of America</em> was the result of his 2,500-mile walk from Phoenix to Washington, DC, that promoted awareness of progressive/emerging Christian faith and inspired a feature-length film called The Asphalt Gospel.

Ann S. Masten explores what allows certain individuals to thrive and adapt despite adverse circumstances, such as poverty, chronic family problems, or exposure to trauma. Coverage encompasses the neurobiology of resilience as well as the role of major contexts of development: families, schools, and culture. Identifying key protective factors in early childhood and beyond, Masten provides a cogent framework for designing programs to promote resilience. Complex concepts are carefully defined and illustrated with real-world examples.</p><p>Ann S. Masten, PhD, is a Regents Professor and the Irving B. Harris Professor of Child Development in the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota. She is former president of the Society for Research in Child Development, a Fellow and former Division President (Division 7: Developmental Psychology) of the American Psychological Association (APA), and a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science. She co-chairs the Forum on Investing in Young Children Globally &nbsp;for the U.S. National Academies. Dr. Masten is an internationally known expert on resilience in human development, with over 170 publications in scientific journals and books. She is a recipient of the 2014 Urie Bronfenbrenner Award for Lifetime Contribution to Developmental Psychology in the Service of Science and Society from the APA.&nbsp;"A truly magnificent book that is very readable, highly informative, and hugely helpful for both understanding resilience and planning how best to foster it. Given that resilience is not a unitary trait, it presents quite a challenge to distill the key points from a complicated literature into straightforward messages, but that is exactly what this book does. It skillfully summarizes the main findings from both qualitative and quantitative research and combines all of that with telling case examples. Essential reading for any researcher or clinician interested in resilience."--Michael Rutter, MD, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom<br><br> "Nobody understands resilience as well as Ann Masten, and nobody writes about it as clearly, wisely, and deeply as she does. Dr. Masten is both a creator of new knowledge and a compelling narrator of the science and interventions that address how children manage to thrive in spite of adverse conditions. This indispensable book conveys the many facets of resilience, from neurobiology to cultural context to the importance of supportive relationships. Accessibly written, it makes complex concepts and processes easy to understand and impossible to forget. The book can be used as a text for undergraduate and graduate courses on typical development and developmental psychopathology, as well as in seminars for clinical interns and postdoctoral fellows."--Alicia F. Lieberman, PhD, Irving B. Harris Endowed Chair in Infant Mental Health and Professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco<br><br> "I consider Masten to be the preeminent thinker on resilience--and one of psychology's very best writers. Few authors possess the theoretical, empirical, clinical, and translational prevention skills to write such an integrative, well-presented volume. Masten makes a critical contribution to understanding the multiple pathways toward resilient outcomes for individuals who have experienced significant adversity. She does an amazing job of integrating literature from a variety of disciplines and levels of analysis. This is by far the best book I have ever read on resilience, and will set the standard for a long time to come."--Dante Cicchetti, PhD, McKnight Presidential Chair of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota<br><br> "Resilience is an invaluable concept for our turbulent times. Masten, a highly esteemed developmental psychologist, has been at the forefront of resilience theory and research for decades. In this beautifully crafted volume, she guides readers through the advances in our knowledge of the multilevel processes--the interactions of neurobiological, psychological, family, and sociocultural influences over time--that enable children and adults to survive and grow stronger from serious life challenges. Essential reading for scholars, students, and mental health professionals who strive to understand and promote positive adaptation in traumatic situations and multistress contexts."--Froma Walsh, MSW, PhD, Mose and Sylvia Firestone Professor Emerita, School of Social Service Administration and Department of Psychiatry, University of Chicago, and Codirector, Chicago Center for Family Health<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Ordinary Magic</i> is an extraordinary achievement. Ann Masten has succeeded in integrating, synthesizing, and extending 40 years of resilience research into a compelling and highly readable volume. The book is audacious in scope, with Masten moving easily from genes to culture writ large. It is a &#x2018;must read&#x2019; for a broad audience, including mental health practitioners, senior scholars, educators, and students.&#x201d;--Deborah Lowe Vandell, PhD, Founding Dean, School of Education, University of California, Irvine<br><br>"For nearly 40 years, Ann Masten has been at the forefront of the ever-changing science of resilience....Masten&#x2019;s intimate involvement with this research makes her uniquely suited to provide a comprehensive and concise overview of developments in resilience research to date....It is not only Masten&#x2019;s critical role in resilience research that makes <i>Ordinary Magic</i> a valuable read. Her clear and skillful writing makes the details of this complex field accessible to a broad audience, ranging from resilience scientists to undergraduate psychology majors. Complex matters are explained in simple terms, making them comprehensible to many readers from wide-ranging disciplines. Masten presents an impressive array of the knowledge that she has gained through her years in the field in a clear and concise manner....<i>Ordinary Magic</i>...centers on the innovative assertion that resilience is common and dependent on ordinary adaptive systems internal and external to individuals. Masten has succeeded in writing a book that expands on this core idea in a manner that is broadly accessible and applicable for researchers, professionals, and students alike.&#x201d;, <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i> Published On: 2016-10-01<br><br>&#x201c;Sheer joy....All scholars wishing to better acquaint themselves with the resilience in development literature would do well to pick up Masten&#x2019;s book and read it solicitously....Applicable for scientists, practitioners, family members, teachers, early interventionists, policymakers, and countless others who genuinely strive for equity and equanimity among all--especially the vulnerable.&#x201d;, <i>Infant Mental Health Journal</i> Published On: 2017-08-01<br><br>&#x201c;I do so wish that this book had been available before I did my doctorate in resilience studies and when I had been teaching this subject....I continue to be very grateful for resilience research and theorizing as a practitioner and, in particular, for this unique summary and stock take of the discipline that Professor Ann Masten provides. <i>Ordinary Magic</i> will be of very great assistance to postgraduate students, and to beginning researchers, because it details the waves of resilience investigations that have brought us to the present day....In my teaching experience, even postgraduate students can have trouble really understanding the resilience perspective, and they will surely benefit from Masten&#x2019;s commitment to expressing complex ideas in straightforward language.&#x201d;<i></i><br>, <i>Psychology Aotearoa</i> Published On: 2015-05-01<br><br>&#x201c;Masten's book deserves reading because of its extraordinary synthesis of selected theories and research....Masten has pulled together the wide range of approaches to the concept and its empirical grounding to this date. This has been a difficult task but the result is essentially a truly new 'manual on resilience,' which will last as a guide to further research for at least the next decade.&#x201d;, <i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> Published On: 2015-03-23<br><br>&#x201c;Ann Masten writes in an accessible narrative style while drawing on her vast personal and professional experience as a professor and international resilience expert....An illuminating and useful text for students, researchers, and anyone interested in this field.&#x201d;, <i>Therapy Today</i> Published On: 2015-02-06<br><br>"Recommended.

Jung Foundation Books Series)</h2><p>In this engaging commentary, the distinguished analyst and author Marie-Louise von Franz shows how the Feminine reveals itself in fairy tales of German, Russian, Scandinavian, and Eskimo origin, including familiar stories such as &#34;Sleeping Beauty,&#34; &#34;Snow White and Rose Red,&#34; and &#34;Rumpelstiltskin.&#34; Some tales, she points out, offer insights into the psychology of women, while others reflect the problems and characteristics of the anima, the inner femininity of men. Dr. von Franz discusses the archetypes and symbolic themes that appear in fairy tales as well as dreams and fantasies, draws practical advice from the tales, and demonstrates its application in case studies from her analytical practice.</p><p>Marie-Louise von Franz (1915&#x2013;1998) was the foremost student of C. G. Jung, with whom she worked closely from 1934 until his death in 1961. A founder of the C. G.

She was crowned Queen of Scotland at nine months of age, and Queen of France at sixteen years; at eighteen she ascended the throne that was her birthright and began ruling one of the most fractious courts in Europe, riven by religious conflict and personal lust for power. She rode out at the head of an army in both victory and defeat; saw her second husband assassinated, and married his murderer. At twenty-five she entered captivity at the hands of her rival queen, from which only death would release her. The life of Mary Stuart is one of unparalleled drama and conflict. From the labyrinthine plots laid by the Scottish lords to wrest power for themselves, to the efforts made by Elizabeth&#39;s ministers to invalidate Mary&#39;s legitimate claim to the English throne, John Guy returns to the archives to explode the myths and correct the inaccuracies that surround this most fascinating monarch. He also explains a central mystery: why Mary would have consented to marry -- only three months after the death of her second husband, Lord Darnley -- the man who was said to be his killer, the Earl of Bothwell. And, more astonishingly, he solves, through careful re-examination of the Casket Letters, the secret behind Darnley&#39;s spectacular assassination at Kirk o&#39;Field. With great pathos, Guy illuminates how the imprisoned Mary&#39;s despair led to a reckless plot against Elizabeth -- and thus to her own execution. The portrait that emerges is not of a political pawn or a manipulative siren, but of a shrewd and charismatic young ruler who relished power and, for a time, managed to hold together a fatally unstable country. MY HEART IS MY OWN is a compelling work of historical scholarship that offers radical new interpretations of an ancient story.</p><p>John Guy is the author of numerous histories, including TUDOR ENGLAND, which has sold more than a quarter of a million copies. He is a Fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and also lectures in the Faculty of History. He became an Honorary Research Professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003&#39;Fascinating...

Matthew became a Christian at the age of ten years old (1672). He studied law and was ordained in 1687 serving as a pastor in Chester, from that same year until 1712. He began to teach the Old Testament in the mornings and the New in the afternoons. This constituted the basis for his future <em>Commentary</em>, which he began writing in 1704. However, he died in 1714, and thirteen non-conformist theologians took care of completing it. His theology is a faithful testimony of evangelical truth, emphasizing man&#x2019;s total depravity and God&#x2019;s sovereign and saving grace.

Look closely and you'll see that theme all through the Bible. Page after page, God delights in turning tragic endings into new beginnings. A childless woman conceives in her old age; a fearful, self-conscious shepherd becomes a leader of millions; and a prostitute becomes a wife and mother in the lineage of Christ. Every biblical fresh start reveals the amazing, awe-inspiring hope we have for our own new beginnings in God's plan for our lives. <br> In YOU CAN BEGIN AGAIN, bestselling author Joyce Meyer explores the beauty and infinite supply of God's love and grace.

Scattered throughout is practical advice such as making up your mind to live differently, understanding your history is not necessarily your destiny, forgiving those who have hurt you, letting go of past mistakes, and the value of small beginnings. Some of the it&#x2019;s-never-too-late stories are of well-known people such as Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame; Lauren Scruggs, the fashion journalist and blogger who lost her left eye and severed her left arm in a horrific accident; and the persistence of a carpenter-turned-actor named Harrison Ford.

Sure to resonate with Meyer&#x2019;s many fans. --June Sawyers</p><h2>The Rapture: Don&#39;t Be Deceived</h2><p>If there&#39;s one thing you don&#39;t want to be deceived about in life, it&#39;s the Biblical truth concerning the Rapture. The Bible says that for those who are left behind after this next great event on God&#39;s end time prophetic calendar, they will be thrust into the 7-year Tribulation, which is not a party. Rather, it&#39;s an outpouring of God&#39;s wrath upon this wicked and rebellious planet which will soon turn into mankind&#39;s greatest nightmare! Unfortunately, there seems to be multitude of opinions out there concerning the purpose and timing of the Rapture which is starting to cause a lot of unnecessary confusion and division. Therefore, The Rapture: Don&#39;t Be Deceived takes a detective&#39;s approach towards the Biblical teaching of the Rapture and examines the many Scriptural facts surrounding it.</p><p></p><h2>I Am Jewish: Personal Reflections Inspired by the Last Words of Daniel Pearl</h2><p><p><b>Being Jewish.

The Foundation's mission is to promote cross-cultural understanding through journalism, music and innovative communications.</p>In February 2002, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was brutally murdered by terrorists in Karachi, Pakistan. Just before he died, he said, "My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish." His parents decided to honor his memory by asking several hundred Jews to record their reactions to his words-statements that form the core of this book. Most of the 146 contributors are well-known authors, educators, rabbis, reporters, entertainers and political figures, including Joseph Lieberman, Michael Medved, Dennis Prager, Elie Wiesel, Dianne Feinstein, Kerri Strug, Richard Dreyfuss and Wendy Wasserstein. The length of their statements varies from a sentence or two to essays that cover several pages. Their thoughts are organized around the five basic themes of identity; heritage; covenant, chosenness and faith; humanity; and tikkun ha'olam (repairing the world). The respondents provide anecdotes, theological formulations, personal reactions, biblical references and historical reflections, ranging widely from the superficial to the profound. Among the few Israeli contributors is Avrum Burg, an outspoken critic of the Sharon government and its policies. He argues eloquently that being a Jew places on him a special obligation to work for peace. Others place different constructions on what it means to be Jewish. Lack of consensus highlights the extreme variations in Jewish views, indicating that one value of this collection is its demonstration that a healthy diversity of opinion continues to characterize the Jewish community.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I kicked at the battery...nothing. The heavy Lexan nose cone of the Abyss Glider sank, bobbing upside-down along the surface like a cork. Staring into the depths of the Monterey Bay Canyon, I saw the female&#x2019;s conical head appear from the shadows, her ghostly albino glow paralyzing me in fear as she charged.<br><strong>Her hideous mouth yawned open, anticipating her next meal&#x2014;me!<br><strong>The thought of this enraged me. Reaching forward, I grabbed the emergency lever and turned it counterclockwise, then yanked it back, igniting the mini-sub&#x2019;s fuel.

Jonas Taylor grabs the cursed instrument off its cradle, strangling the receiver in his grip. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uh...Mr. Taylor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Speaking.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sir, this is Ross Colombo.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know any Ross Colombo.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;With American Express.

Stares at his computer monitor.<br>Writing his memoirs had been Terry&#x2019;s idea. To Jonas, it seemed like a waste of time, a last desperate attempt to regain lost years of fame. Still, he had to make a living, and his once overflowing well of requests for speaking engagements had run dry long ago.<br><em>Face it, Jonas, you&#x2019;re a has-been&#x2014;yesterday&#x2019;s news.

Health insurance, car insurance, mortgage payments, phone bills, electric bills...every month the mountain of debt gets higher, every waking moment dominated by stress. He has borrowed against the house, maxed out his credit cards, dipped into the kids&#x2019; college funds...and still the mountain grows, along with his pessimism about the future and his constant fear of poverty.<br>Jonas Taylor can&#x2019;t remember the last time he has laughed out loud. Or even smiled.<br>His eyes focus upon the top statement in the stack, his annual life insurance bill&#x2014;the irony of his life. <em>Bankrupt in life, rich in death. At least you married a younger woman.

Finish the book. Terry will sell it, and the rest will take care of itself.</em><br>He returns to the keyboard.<br>* * *<br><strong>Darkness rushed at me, but before I could comprehend the consequences of my actions, I was jolted into unconsciousness. When I awoke, I was startled to be alive. The pod, miraculously, was still intact, but was now rolling in horrible darkness, the nose cone&#x2019;s exterior light occasionally illuminating refuse from the monster&#x2019;s last meal.

Tries the handle. <em>Locked, of course. Pounds on the door.

For company Henry has his long-divorced mother, Adele&#x2014;a onetime dancer whose summer project was to teach him how to foxtrot; his hamster, Joe; and awkward Saturday-night outings to Friendly's with his estranged father and new stepfamily. As much as he tries, Henry knows that even with his jokes and his "Husband for a Day" coupon, he still can't make his emotionally fragile mother happy. Adele has a secret that makes it hard for her to leave their house, and seems to possess an irreparably broken heart. </p> <p> But all that changes on the Thursday before Labor Day, when a mysterious bleeding man named Frank approaches Henry and asks for a hand. Over the next five days, Henry will learn some of life's most valuable lessons: how to throw a baseball, the secret to perfect piecrust, the breathless pain of jealousy, the power of betrayal, and the importance of putting others&#x2014;especially those we love&#x2014;above ourselves. And the knowledge that real love is worth waiting for. </p> <p> In a manner evoking Ian McEwan's <i>Atonement</i> and Nick Hornby's <i>About a Boy</i>, acclaimed author Joyce Maynard weaves a beautiful, poignant tale of love, sex, adolescence, and devastating treachery as seen through the eyes of a young teenage boy&#x2014;and the man he later becomes&#x2014;looking back at an unexpected encounter that begins one single long, hot, life-altering weekend. </p> <p> <strong>The Obsessions Behind <i>Labor Day</i>: An Essay by Joyce Maynard</strong> </p> <p> </p><p></p>I always tell students, when I teach writing, to locate their obsessions, and look to them when they&#x2019;re searching for the story they should be telling. When a writer attaches her work to the engine of what she cares about most passionately (even irrationally, perhaps) the work will be infused with a similar passion, I believe. And come into being most organically. <p></p>This new novel of mine--though it&#x2019;s a product of my imagination, not my experience--contains elements of so many of my deepest obsessions. I think that&#x2019;s why I wrote it so easily and swiftly--almost as if I were transcribing a story being dictated to me from inside my brain. <p></p>Anyone who has read my work for a while can recognize a few obvious connections to my history, starting with the experience of having been, for many years, a single parent of sons (also a daughter) living in a small town not unlike the imaginary town in which I located the novel. I like to think I have a somewhat more stable and grounded hold on reality and life in the world than Adele (and I am, if anything, the opposite of agoraphobic). But I share a number of her attributes: For starters, there&#x2019;s a hugely romantic nature and a love of dancing (though not her abilities on the dance floor; that part is the stuff of fantasy.) On a deeper level, though, I understand well the sorrow and regret a woman feels when the dream of family life as she envisioned it has left her. My sons--though I like to think they would weigh in with more positive feelings about their growing up years than negative ones--could certainly identify with the feelings Henry has, of undue responsibility for his mother. (Henry&#x2019;s innocent gift, to Adele, of the Husband-for-a-Day coupon was inspired by a similar gift presented to me one Christmas by my son Charlie, when he was around nine or ten.) <p></p>I am always interested--no, fascinated--by children&#x2019;s perceptions of the adults in their world. The mysterious subject of sex, the first discovery of one&#x2019;s own sexuality, and the disquieting experience-- for a child of divorced parents in particular--of witnessing a parent&#x2019;s sexuality even as they embark on their own sexual lives. Complicated enough, when a child is contemplating the idea of his parents together--but the experience for a young person (a boy in particular) of seeing his mother with some other man is one I have thought about for a long time. (Ever since my son Willy--then age seven--responded to my going out on a date for the first time, after separating from his father, by taking a kitchen knife and plunging it directly into the crotch of a cardboard effigy of the country singer Randy Travis that I had propped up in our front hall . . . Willy is now 24 by the way. A very healthy person who displays no signs of being a psychopath.) <p></p>Back to the obsession list. My experience of having gone through a painful custody battle many years ago--and the horrifying experience of being evaluated as a mother by a guardian ad litem--is in there. My history as a teenage girl with eating disorders also surfaced in this story, along with the guilt I carry about a betrayal I committed--at around that time in life--of a classmate&#x2019;s trust in me, when around age fourteen--an event that formed the basis for the first story I ever published in a magazine (<i>Seventeen</i>), somewhere around 1970 . . . <p></p>Another experience that found its way into this novel (and one I also wrote about, in non-fiction form, a few years back) was a kind of fantasy love affair I found myself in, when I was myself a young and very lonely single mother, living in a small New Hampshire town with my three young children, and I got a letter (first one, then a hundred more) from a man in prison, who seemed to know and understand me better than anyone else. (I eventually learned--when it appeared he was getting out of prison and coming to visit my children and me--that this man was a double murderer. I first told the story at The Moth in New York, and later wrote it in an essay that appeared in Vogue, and in a collection published a few years back, called <i>Mr. Wrong</i>.) <p></p>I will add here, that this is the third time in which I have chosen, for the central character of a novel of mine, a character who is thirteen years old. This is clearly an age that means a lot to me, and though I haven&#x2019;t been thirteen for many decades, I still feel very connected to that time of life. <p></p>One odd little obsession that I included in the novel, with particular pleasure, concerns pie. Ever since the death of my mother, nineteen years ago, I have set myself the task of teaching pie-making to anyone I encounter who expresses frustration with making good crust--and the numbers of my past students have long since entered the triple digits. (I have also often run large gatherings of pie students at my home, to raise money for my political candidate. Always a Democrat . . .) I could talk a lot about what this pie exercise means to me--certainly it has to do with my mother, but also with honoring the old ways of doing things by hand, and paying attention to instinct (more than a recipe). And I have to add, I love it that I was able to include, in a work of fiction, instructions for making a pie crust that really will result in a good pie, if followed. <p></p>The final obsession I will mention here--and it is the one that inspired my first novel, <i>Baby Love</i>, twenty-eight years ago--is babies. Although I am very different from Adele in many ways, the way she feels about having a baby is how I felt all my life. And what Frank says concerning the importance of paying attention to babies--and later, his thoughts are echoed by Henry, when he becomes a parent of a daughter--is everything I believe, myself. I have never met a baby I didn&#x2019;t like, or a crying baby I didn&#x2019;t feel I could bring to a state of calm. I just like babies a whole lot, and loved writing about that part here. <p></p>I want to add: I did not intentionally set out to address any of these topics. They just came out, because they&#x2019;re all the things that interest me most. No doubt this is why I loved writing this novel and wrote it so fast. (I could not stop writing.) I wanted to read it.<p>Joyce Maynard is the author of eight previous novels, including <em>To Die For, Labor Day, The Good Daughters</em>, and four books of nonfiction.

(Or should I say Many Happy Solar Returns! &#x2018;Solar&#x2019; because the Sun returns to the same place as it was on the day you were born. Hence the saying!)<br> &nbsp;<br> I'm delighted to welcome you to my Book of Birthdays, a venture which has been tremendously exciting and rewarding to develop, and which is borne from many years studying astrology, the great systems of the universe and the fascinating people of every race and nation who dwell within our world. As a Sun and Moon Aquarian, I am a natural observer of individual people and their characters.<br> &nbsp;<br> My life as an astrologer has brought me into contact with incalculable numbers of people over the last thirty years, through viewers' direct and personal response to my appearances on television, my columns in national and regional newspapers, and as a result of my many astrological books. I have also had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world who have sought my help. They range from members of our own Royal Family, to business magnates in the City here and Wall Street in America, politicians, television pundits, actors, actresses, editors of our own national newspapers and magazines, to people from all sorts of less high-profile professions and jobs. Rich or poor, we are all concerned about our destiny and certainly want to make the best of it. I count many clients among my dearest friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> But, of course, apart from astrology, I am also deeply involved in other allied disciplines. Chinese astrology and other Oriental belief systems have taken my interest for many years and become an integral part of my professional and personal pursuit of knowledge. Other studies include my own work on systems of numerology, palmistry, some forms of magic and many areas of ancient Celtic wisdom. Perhaps one of my most personally rewarding studies, and indeed discoveries, has been the Astro-Tarot pack, created by me and taken up by followers all over the world. This acted as the tool through which I could channel my psychic energy and fulfilled my ambition to combine my expertise of the tarot with my knowledge of astrology, making the Astro-Tarot a school for learning both disciplines.<br> &nbsp;<br> Astrologers and followers of these other studies have always accepted that we are all influenced by the geographical place, date and timing of our birth. Birth rituals to record this are performed in ancient religions and cultures all over the world. And we accept that certain characteristics are associated with each birth sign motivated by a particular planet in a sensitive area of our own unique natal chart. But in my own studies I have long held the opinion that your character is not only affected by your sun sign but by the exact date you were born, and the intricate astrological influences that are cast from it. Even Carl Jung, the great psychologist, stressed that each and every one of us is born with a huge collective of characteristics in a kind of universal archetype, influenced by the time we are born within the natural cycle of the year. The rhythms of the year are determined by the seasons - the changes between spring, summer, autumn and winter - along with the lengthening and shortening of days and nights. It corresponds that those born in the heat of the summer differ to those born in the cold light of a short winter's day (and of course this still applies if you are born in the southern hemisphere where the seasons are reversed).<br> &nbsp;<br> With this awareness of the undeniable pull of nature combined with the basic principles of psychology and astrology it seems clear to me that destiny is influenced by the individual date of birth, irrespective of the year, allowing us to make personal choices in our own exclusive way. Dr Marc Edmunds Jones, in his stimulating and penetrating book The Sabian Symbols in Astrology, draws similar conclusions by emphasising not the actual date of birth but the symbolic meaning attached to each of the 360 degrees of the zodiac wheel.<br> &nbsp;<br> What has also cemented this conviction for me is the knowledge gained from my perhaps less well-known psychic and Spiritualist experiences. For many years I have practised as a medium and have had the privilege to work with my dear friend, one of the wisest psychics of all, Doris Stokes, now passed on to a greater world. I have many clients with this work. Some come to me for healing, others simply to consult through my clairvoyant ability. As President Emeritus of the prestigious body, The British Astrological-Psychic Society, I am able to keep in touch with current thinking about the New Age. Using this psychic ability I have been able to synthesise knowledge and experience, honing them to an outline of the characteristics of individual dates - hence the 'psycheology' of every birthday in the year.<br> &nbsp;<br> You'll find that each psycheology gives an insightful outline of the characteristics you might find for every birthday boy or girl as well as snippets of information about events that occurred on your date of birth, a thought for the day, the element (fire, earth, air or water) attributed to your sun sign and the names of celebrities born on the same day. It also includes sections loosely gathered under the headings &#x2018;Mind&#x2019; and &#x2018;Body&#x2019;. These can cover a whole range of physical and emotional attributes and are written to appeal to each birthdate's individual character and interests.<br> &nbsp;<br> Remember that each psycheology, as with all astrological readings, acts rather like a signpost - the road doesn't have to be taken. This is a book which is invaluable as a guide, not as an ordinance on how you must lead your life. Glean from it what you can in the journey to discover more about the inherent nature and destiny of yourself, your friends and loved ones, and the choices that are open to fulfil your self-potential.<br> &nbsp;<br> The word psycheology may be new in our language at least - but it describes something in us all that is as old as time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Book of Birthdays begins with a general outline of the characteristics of each sun sign archetype. Every sign is subdivided into three equal segments called decanates or decans. A decanate is a different vibration of the three signs and their ruling planets associated with the element (fire, earth, air or water) from which they form a part. The first decanate always starts with the nature of the sign in question followed in correct order with the next two from the family of the same element.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have rounded off the decanate dates to come up with the most accurate and acceptable periods possible. This is because the start and finish of both star signs and decanates will, of course, alter yearly.<br> &nbsp;<br> We then follow with psycheologies for every birthday of the year. Several of the psycheologies utilise the principles of my Astro-Tarot for added insight into the character and personality of a particular birthday. On occasion, numerology has also been used.

He expected her to put up a fight, but instead found her exhausted and utterly broken. Maybe it was unfair, asking her to marry him when she was so vulnerable. But this much he knew: he would spend a lifetime helping to make her whole again.The war had taken everything from Anya--her family, her friends, her home, her faith. She clung to the walls she&#39;d fortressed around her heart, but what future did she have apart from Danny? At least she wouldn&#39;t be alone anymore.Or so she thought.

As England picks up the pieces of war&#39;s debris in the months that follow, Anya shares a flat with three other war brides in London and rediscovers the healing bond of friendships.Once again, Danny and Anya find themselves oceans apart, their marriage confined to little more than the handwritten pages of their letters while wondering if the shadow of war will ever diminish.</p><p>Born in Texas and raised in Oklahoma, Diane Hale Moody is a graduate of Oklahoma State University.

Mary McAuliffe traces a decade that saw seismic change on almost every front, from art and architecture to music, literature, fashion, entertainment, transportation, and, most notably, behavior. <br>The epicenter of all this creativity, as well as of the era&#x2019;s good times, was Montparnasse, where impoverished artists and writers found colleagues and caf�s, and tourists discovered the Paris of their dreams. Major figures on the Paris scene&#x2014;such as Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Picasso, Stravinsky, Diaghilev, and Proust&#x2014;continued to hold sway, while others now came to prominence&#x2014;including Ernest Hemingway, Coco Chanel, Cole Porter, and Josephine Baker, as well as Andr� Citro�n, Le Corbusier, Man Ray, Sylvia Beach, James Joyce, and the irrepressible Kiki of Montparnasse.<br>Paris of the 1920s unquestionably sizzled. Yet rather than being a decade of unmitigated bliss, les Ann�es folles also saw an undercurrent of despair as well as the rise of ruthless organizations of the extreme right, aimed at annihilating whatever threatened tradition and order&#x2014;a struggle that would escalate in the years ahead. Through rich illustrations and evocative narrative, Mary McAuliffe brings this vibrant era to life.</p><p>Mary McAuliffe holds a PhD in history from the University of Maryland, has taught at several universities, and has lectured at the Smithsonian Institution.

(<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Rich with the flavor of words taken from primary sources, [Mary McAuliffe] provides an intimate look at the very human side of history. (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>McAuliffe deftly explores the inner lives of the artists and those who surrounded them, and in the process humanizes these larger-than-life characters. For McAuliffe, these demigods of the art world were ordinary people who fell in love, mourned the loss of loved ones and worried increasingly about their financial security and their legacy. . . . McAuliffe has added a truly remarkable degree of insight into both the lives of the participants and the turbulent world they inhabited. McAuliffe paints with broad, majestic strokes a world that has been lost to us or perhaps never was. (<i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Fascinating trivia about artists in turn-of-the-century Paris adds layers of insight to a time of growth and experimentation. . . . McAuliffe is uniquely positioned to bring this crowded cast of characters to life. She does a thorough job of cataloging the wide range of artistic and scientific achievements while managing to also offer surprising tidbits that add texture to the narrative. . . . McAuliffe&#x2019;s knowledge of and enthusiasm for this time is evident on every page.

Few &#x201c;old timer&#x201d; players have mastered this style but fortunately some committed players like Art Rosenbaum and Mike Seeger have preserved this heritage and kept the style present. And now in three installments, Sebastian Schroeder will introduce you to this interesting style. In this second 2-finger book the focus will be on Thumb Lead Style. Here the melody tones are plucked by the thumb, while the first and fifth string is played by thumb or index finger as drone strings. The tones of the lower strings of the banjo are easier when played in the Thumb Lead Style. So this add a nice contrast when accompanying singing or other instruments. Therefore this is also a good style for ballads. This book includes 48 pages for banjo beginners and advanced players, 48 downloadable audio examples and tablature for all exercises and songs.

To get in touch with both aspects, they provide exercises to help enter your inner universe and find whatever you are looking for when contemplating various symbols. Though the guide is organized thematically rather than alphabetically as most symbol dictionaries are arranged, it still works well as a reference manual. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Vive con su esposa, Ann Jonas, cerca del R�o Hudson, en Nueva York. </p>PreSchool-Grade 2 This revised and redesigned edition of Crews' 1968 book contains several changes that give the title more appeal. The larger format makes the book a more useful choice for story hour sessions. Larger and more legible type makes reading easier for beginners. Although the rhymed text to introduce objects from one to ten remains almost unchanged, the colors of the objects have been altered, and textures have been added for visual variety. The rake now moves through tiny grass bits, for example, and the piggy bank looks more like a pink porker than did its brown predecessor. Crews' unmistakable graphic style is still evident, and the striking visuals are the book's strong feature. Unfortunately, Crews does not avoid one pitfall that plagues many picture books: the relationship between objects of different sizes. The two dots that are the fox's eyes are the same size as the two in the eyes of keys on the opposite page. Hence, each key is almost as large as the head of a fox. An addition in the new version is a series of black dots to be counted at the end of the book. Despite some weaknesses, the book is a good choice for collections in which straightforward counting books are in high demand.Kathy Piehl, Mankato State University, Minn.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Young&#39;s Literal Translation (YLT) Bible: Complete Old and New Testament</h2><p>Now with page references for easy navigation!Many Bible translations suffer from translator bias.

Should infants be baptized before their faith is conscious, or does God command the baptism of babies whose parents have been baptized?<br><br>Popular New Testament scholar Scot McKnight makes a biblical case for infant baptism, exploring its history, meaning, and practice and showing that infant baptism is the most historic Christian way of forming children into the faith. He explains that the church's practice of infant baptism developed straight from the Bible and argues that it must begin with the family and then extend to the church. Baptism is not just an individual profession of faith: it takes a family and a church community to nurture a child into faith over time. McKnight explains infant baptism for readers coming from a tradition that baptizes adults only, and he counters criticisms that fail to consider the role of families in the formation of faith. The book includes a foreword by Todd Hunter and an afterword by Gerald McDermott.</p><p><b>"McKnight has given the church an enduring gift"<br></b><br>"As someone who grew up Baptist and has wrestled deeply with questions about infant baptism, I wish I could have read this book years ago. McKnight has given the church an enduring gift--a book that is theologically rich, serious, and steeped in tradition yet accessible and readable. As a mother of young children and as a priest, I will put this book in the hands of many a friend and parishioner. If you are a parent deciding whether to baptize infant children, this book is essential reading."<br>--<b>Tish Harrison Warren</b>, priest in the ACNA, co-associate rector (Church of the Ascension Pittsburgh), and author of <i>Liturgy of the Ordinary: Sacred Practices in Everyday Life<br></i><br>"Able, strong, wise, and biblically and theologically rich. There are a great number of confusions and misunderstandings about infant baptism that Scot thoughtfully clarifies. So even if you don't end up being convinced, you will know why people like Scot (and me) think it is a practice essential for proper Christian discipleship."<br>--<b>Mark Galli</b>, editor in chief, <i>Christianity Today<br><br></i>"A cogent apology for the sacrament of infant baptism. McKnight, a New Testament scholar, writes in a comfortable and non-academic style that his readers will surely appreciate."<br>--<b>Kathryn Greene-McCreight</b>, Episcopal priest and&nbsp;author of <i>Darkness Is My Only Companion: A Christian Response to Mental Illness</i><br><br>"McKnight provides a controversial though ultimately compelling case for infant baptism. It is not just the who and how of baptism that he tackles; the genius of this book is that McKnight elegantly explains what baptism is even about, what it means, what it does for the recipient, and why it really does take a church to baptize a child. This book could change your whole view of conversion, faith, family, children's ministry, and the church!"<br>--<b>Michael&nbsp;F. Bird</b>, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia<br><br>"The most compelling case for infant baptism available today. Not content to sprinkle with prooftexts, McKnight immerses his reader in the biblical, historical, and sacramental theology of this ancient Christian practice, and seals it with a testimony of how his mind was changed."<br>--<b>Joel Scandrett</b>, Robert&nbsp;E.

In this picture book biography, Deere is introduced as a blacksmith living in Vermont in the 1830s. After his forge burned down twice, Deere decided to move west. Trying to use traditional plows in the tough, sticky Illinois prairie ground was a difficult and time-consuming endeavor. Through trial and testing, Deere came up with a plow that made the work quicker and easier. (A note at the end provides further information about Deere and the development of the company.) Told in a conversational manner, the factual narrative is well matched to the folk art&#x2014;style illustrations. Rendered in acrylic paint on plywood, along with stains and glazes, the pictures effectively reflect the subject and the time period. Although Deere was not widely known or documented in his own time, historians have worked with "recollections of family and friends, notes in diaries, newspaper articles, letters, and business materials." The author includes a lengthy source list and suggests visiting the John Deere company website.

George Gheverghese Joseph takes us on a breathtaking multicultural tour of the roots and shoots of non-European mathematics. He shows us the deep influence that the Egyptians and Babylonians had on the Greeks, the Arabs' major creative contributions, and the astounding range of successes of the great civilizations of India and China.</p><br><p> The third edition emphasizes the dialogue between civilizations, and further explores how mathematical ideas were transmitted from East to West. The book's scope is now even wider, incorporating recent findings on the history of mathematics in China, India, and early Islamic civilizations as well as Egypt and Mesopotamia. With more detailed coverage of proto-mathematics and the origins of trigonometry and infinity in the East, <i>The Crest of the Peacock</i> further illuminates the global history of mathematics.</p></p><p>When we hear that mathematics is both the most noble endeavor of our species and that it was born in Europe, we naturally tend to be suspicious. Few writers could be as well-qualified to write about ancient math across the world as George Gheverghese Joseph, whose <i>The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics</i> is a bright example of clear exposition and argument. Though the topic might intimidate those averse to mathematics, history, non-Western cultures, or some combination thereof, the book is essential for any reader who seeks a clearer understanding of any one of those. Joseph doesn't make things easy for nonmathematicians or nonhistorians, but the pleasure of meeting his challenge is robust. He explains ancient African, American, and Asian methods of counting and manipulating numbers with ease, paying particular attention to the historical development of and interrelationships between cultures. When discussing systems of mathematics as complex as those taught in ancient India and China, Joseph includes sample problems and discussions to help the interested student see numbers as past learners did. The revised edition includes a lengthy section, titled "Reflections," that updates and expands much of the material. Few readers will be able to match Joseph's grasp of both history and mathematics, but all will find <i>The Crest of the Peacock</i> as delightful and elegant as its subjects. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>George Gheverghese Joseph</b> was born in Kerala, India, grew up in Mombasa, Kenya, and completed his degrees in England.

To create such a classroom community, good teachers make a point of getting to know every child and family well. They make the effort to learn about each child&#x2019;s personality, abilities, interests, and ways of learning, and they work to build a strong sense of group identity among the children in the group. Toward this end, teachers plan ways for children to work and play together collaboratively, and they work to bring each child&#x2019;s home culture and language into the shared culture of the class.</p><h2>Board of Certification Study Guide -- Clinical Laboratory Certification Examinations, Enhanced 6th Edition</h2><p>The new enhanced 6th Edition of The Board of Certification Study Guide continues as the authoritative study tool for preparing for the ASCP Board of Certification (BOC) Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) and Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT) certification examinations.

So they gather their telescope and their lantern and head out into the dark night, all the way to the edge of their branch. Try as they might, though, they can only see leaves...and branches...and more leaves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these two friends are not about to let a little obstacle like <i>foliage</i> stop them. Armed with camping gear, galoshes&#x2014;and their wits, of course!&#x2014;Owly and Wormy set out once again. And this time there are even bigger challenges to face. What&#x2019;s that <i>screee</i> sound? What&#x2019;s that <i>click click clicking</i> noise? And what has happened to their telescope?!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owly and Wormy find plenty to be frightened of, but with a little bravery, they also find there are nearly as many helpful new friends on the horizon as there are stars in the sky.

When heavy rains drive them into a cave that night, and eerie &#x201c;Clickety skreeeeeeeee&#x201d; noises send them scrambling back out, the telescope goes missing. This prompts Owly to screw his courage to the sticking place, leave his shivering buddy behind and set off on a search. As in Owly&#x2019;s previous picture-book (<i>Friends All Aflutter</i>, 2011) and graphic-novel appearances, the tale is told in big, easy-to-grasp sequential cartoons, with wordless pictures and signs in balloons creating a nonverbal language that serves just fine in place of narration or dialogue. Owly returns in triumph with not only the telescope, but a set of friendly bats to explain the scary sound effects. In a final bit of both plot and emotional resolution, Wormy&#x2019;s fear of the dark is transformed to delight as the camp&#x2019;s candle is blown out, and the seemingly empty skies overhead suddenly blaze with stars. <br> <br> Young readers and pre-readers alike will respond strongly to the tale&#x2019;s elemental drama and clearly defined emotional arc."<br> <br> <i>--Kirkus Reviews, </i>September 15, 2012 <b>*STAR</b></p><h2>The End of America?: Bible Prophecy and a Country in Crisis</h2><p><p><b>Will God's Wrath Fall on America?</b></p><p> What happens when a country glories in its immorality, turning away from faith in God and obedience to Him? <br><br> Jeff Kinley, author of <i>As It Was in the Days of Noah</i>, explores historical and biblical precedents for the demise of a nation and addresses pressing questions such as...</p><ul><li>How did we get to this point?</li><li>Is America in Bible prophecy?</li><li>Will Christians face widespread persecution here?</li><li>What effect will the rapture have on America?</li><li>How should <i>I</i> respond to the moral decline?</li></ul><p> This forthright survey of current events and trends offers valuable perspective on the future of America&#x2014;along with powerful motivation to embrace the only source of lasting hope.</p></p><p><p><b>Jeff Kinley</b> (ThM, Dallas Theological Seminary) has authored over 30 books and speaks across the country.

The Married Man Sex Life Primer 2011 cherry picks the best ideas of books like "The Mystery Method," "No More Mr. Nice Guy," and the volatile online world of the Pickup Artist a.k.a. "Game" community and merges them with a solid grounding in evolutionary psychology, sociology, biology and behavior modification. The result is a simple, effective plan for men to create sexually exciting marriages for themselves and their wives.<br><br>The opening covers the underlying ancient "hard-wired" biological and modern social reasons women find men attractive. Athol pulls no punches here and the sexual motivations of women are laid bare. Though rather than framing women as sexually devious and seeking to advantage themselves over men, he explains how their sexual behavior is entirely rational in nature and once understood as such, it becomes very useful information. <br><br>The second part of the book takes the framework developed in the first part and offers a wealth of tools to put it to practical use. The most important tool is The Male Action Plan, which charges the husband with the task of becoming a better, sexier man and thereby leveraging his increased attractiveness for a better sex life with his wife. As Athol says, "whoever is the most attractive in the relationship is in charge."<br><br>The third part of the book is a treasure trove of playful sexy and romantic moves women will find charming and engaging. It's clear that Athol could have a harem of young ladies, but here he displays an endless variety of playful instigation to continually charm just one. The final section is a catchall of serious topics on what not to do, how to choose a wife, the current state of marriage law and a crushingly simple approach to dealing with being cheated on. <br><br>(Want a better man? Leave it where he can find it.)</p><p>Athol Kay is an innovative thinker, humorist and family man with a one track mind. He is a "Mixed Marital Artist" combining a variety of relationship approaches from evolutionary psychology, Pickup Artist "Game", sociology, biology, life experience, romance novels, crappy women's magazines, far too many books, blogging, behavior modification and cheap porn. He has distilled all this research into a few outstandingly effective tactics for gaining happiness and sex in marriage.<br><br>Athol was born in New Zealand and met Jennifer nine days before he was due to fly home after working on a summer camp in Maryland in 1991. Long distance for three years, they finally married in 1994. Married for 16 years, they have two daughters and live in Connecticut. They have a carefully balanced relationship where Athol dreams up all kinds of weird stuff, and Jennifer doesn't leave him.<br><br>The author is also aware that has painted himself into a corner by writing a book on monogamy. At around 112,500 words, it is the longest chastity belt in existence. It only chafes a little.</p><h2>The Forgotten Spurgeon</h2><p>This book seeks to throw light on the reasons which have given rise to the superficial image of Spurgeon as a genial Victorian pulpiteer, a kind of grandfather of modern evangelicalism. Even before his death in 1892 newspapers and church leaders disputed over the features of his life which entitled him to fame. Not his &#39;narrow creed&#39; but his &#39;genuine loving character&#39; was most worthy of remembrance said one periodical, echoing the general view. When Joseph Parker contrasted the hard Calvinism preached at Spurgeon&#39;s Tabernacle with the praiseworthy Christianity exemplified in his orphanage, The Baptist protested that the man about whom Parker wrote &#39;is not the Spurgeon of history&#39;. But the distortion continued and Spurgeon forecast how the position he help might fare in years to come: &#39;I am quite willing to be eaten by dogs for the next fifty years but the more distant future shall vindicate me&#39;. This book traces the main lines of Spurgeon&#39;s spiritual thought in connection with the three great controversies in his ministry.</p><p></p><h2>DKfindout!

Flora and Ralph think of several scenarios but in the end they still have "bean thirteen" left over. Even inviting their friends for dinner doesn't resolve the problem. Whether they plan on one guest or six, the beans cannot be arranged into equal portions. Then Ralph accidentally knocks the beans to the floor as their company arrives. He places all 13 into one bowl and each guest takes as many as he or she would like to eat. This resolves the problem, but leaves Flora and Ralph wondering who ended up consuming unlucky "bean thirteen." The story's pacing and the dialogue between the two bugs help children analyze the situation and follow the different possible grouping solutions. The large, limalike beans are a great visual aid and are easy to see when the book is read aloud. Done in pen and ink with digital effects, the cartoon illustrations feature bright hues and slightly off-kilter perspectives that will appeal to children. Youngsters will undoubtedly enjoy this funny tale; teachers will truly appreciate the connections it makes to their curriculum and the use of manipulatives in math.&#x2014;<i>Maura Bresnahan, High Plain Elementary School, Andover, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the nature of work changes and technology carries things across the globe in a moment, communication skills become more valuable&#x2015;not less.

He is a former public-school teacher and is chairman of the board of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary. He is the author of <em>Practicing Affirmation</em>. Sam and his wife, Vicki, live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and have two daughters and six grandchildren.</p><p>&#x201c;In a permissive culture that leaves parents unsure of their authority and confused about discipline, this book speaks with clarity, not only reminding parents that discipline is a critical element of parental love, but also showing parents how to practically discipline their children in a way that is consistent, God honoring, and productive.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul David Tripp</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Paul Tripp Ministries; author, <em>New Morning Mercies</em> and <em>Suffering</em></p><p>&#x201c;My wife and I were fortunate to attend a seminar on parenting young children featuring Sam Crabtree. He revealed the inconsistency and lack of logic often found in parenting young children and offered better alternatives. We were fortunate because we were able to take his wisdom and apply it to our children at just the right time. I have no doubt that many (if not all) parents experience the same sort of exasperation we did with our first child. And I have no doubt they will find Sam&#x2019;s wisdom in <i>Parenting with Loving Correction</i> as helpful as we did.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul K. Lim, MD</strong><strong>,</strong> Trustee, Bethlehem College&nbsp;&amp; Seminary; surgeon</p><p>&#x201c;When my wife and I read this book, we immediately saw its value and wanted others to read it, so I was pleased when our small group agreed to go through it. But I was also a bit nervous&#x2015;would the subject of parental discipline create conflict during group discussions because of differing parenting styles? Would the concept of correction (which is often considered in our culture to be overly negative) result in gloomy conversations? I needn&#x2019;t have worried. Sam Crabtree uses definitions, Scripture, and helpful anecdotes to get everyone on the same page. His pastoral heart is shown in each chapter as he writes with care, grace, and humility. I can tell you from personal experience that this book yields fruitful discussion&#x2015;and parenting. Chapter 3 ends with this statement: &#x2018;There is great hope. And there is help.&#x2019; For the believing parent, there is. And you will find both in this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Scott Jamison</strong><strong>,</strong> small-group leader</p><p>&#x201c;As parents, it can seem like we&#x2019;re constantly training, correcting, and disciplining our children.

Natalie is different from the other girls in Dreenie's fifth-grade class. She comes to school in a wheelchair, always wearing a knitted hat. The kids call her "Bluish" because her skin is tinted blue from chemotherapy. Dreenie is fascinated by Bluish -- and a little scared of her, too. She watches Bluish and writes her observations in her journal. Slowly, the two girls become good friends. But Dreenie still struggles with with Bluish's illness. Bluish is weak and frail, but she also wants to be independent and respected. How do you act around a girl like that?</p><p>Bluish is unlike any girl 10-year-old Dreenie has ever seen. At school she sits in a wheelchair, her skin so pale it's almost blue. Dreenie, herself new to the New York City magnet school, is fascinated by her, but wary as well. Unaware that the name Bluish could have derogatory connotations ("Blewish," for Black and Jewish), she fixates on the moonlight blue skin tones of this curiously fragile child. Together with Tuli, a bi-racial girl who pretends to be Spanish (often with poignantly comical results), the three carefully forge a bond of friendship, stumbling often as they confront issues of illness, ethnicity, culture, need, and hope.<p> This novel has an edgy quality that may disconcert some readers until they find the rhythm. Bouncing back and forth between Dreenie's first person journal entries and a third person narrative, the motion is a little unsettling. The overall theme is powerful, however, and Virginia Hamilton's skill in addressing the intense and subtle nuances of female friendships is impressive. No surprise, there; with over 30 books for young readers under her belt, and an armful of honors including the Newbery Medal for <i>M.C. Higgins, the Great</i>, three Newbery Honor Awards, the National Book Award, and many more, Hamilton is a formidable voice in children's literature.

Now esteemed biographer Alison Weir provides a fresh perspective and restores these women to their rightful place in history.<br><br> Spanning the years from the Norman conquest in 1066 to the dawn of a new era in 1154, when Henry II succeeded to the throne and Eleanor of Aquitaine, the first Plantagenet queen, was crowned, this epic book brings to vivid life five women, including: Matilda of Flanders, wife of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king; Matilda of Scotland, revered as &#x201c;the common mother of all England&#x201d;; and Empress Maud, England&#x2019;s first female ruler, whose son King Henry II would go on to found the Plantagenet dynasty. More than those who came before or after them, these Norman consorts were recognized as equal sharers in sovereignty. Without the support of their wives, the Norman kings could not have ruled their disparate dominions as effectively.<br><br> Drawing from the most reliable contemporary sources, Weir skillfully strips away centuries of romantic lore to share a balanced and authentic take on the importance of these female monarchs. What emerges is a seamless royal saga, an all-encompassing portrait of English medieval queenship, and a sweeping panorama of British history.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Queens of the Conquest</i><br><br></b>&#x201c;Best-selling author [Alison] Weir pens another readable, well-researched English history, the first in a proposed four-volume series on England&#x2019;s medieval queens. . . .

She lives in Surrey, England, with her husband.<p>Prologue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine a land centuries before industrialization, a rural, green land of vast royal forests and open fields, wild moorlands and undrained marshlands, with scattered villages overshadowed by towering castles, and small, bustling walled towns. A land inhabited by just two million people, whose lives were dominated by the twin calendars imposed by farming and the Church.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a realm torn by conflicts between Church and Crown, and by centuries of strife between the indigenous Anglo--Saxon population and the land--hungry Danes; a realm that bore the scars of the savagery of the Viking invaders, who had colonized parts of the island&#x2019;s north and east&#x2014;-yet nevertheless a realm in which trade and learning flourished, and kings traced their lineage back through the mists of time to Noah and the Norse god Woden. This was an age of faith and superstition, and an age of bloody warfare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine, in place of today&#x2019;s modern traffic and electronic noise, the sound of birdsong, animals, church bells, plainchant, human voices and the occasional hunting horn or strumming of a lyre. This pleasant land, this rural landscape, was England in the time of the Norman queens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We Are Come for Glory&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The news was stupendous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The messenger from England arrived in Normandy soon after 14 October 1066. He found the Duchess, Matilda of Flanders, on her knees, praying for her lord&#x2019;s safety, in a chapel of the priory she had founded, Notre--Dame de Pr�, near Rouen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her husband, William, Duke of Normandy, had launched his invasion of England the previous month, intent on seizing the throne he believed was rightfully his. He had endured a terrible crossing in stormy weather. Making land on 28 September at Pevensey, on England&#x2019;s south coast, he had stumbled and fallen on the beach. His followers had cried out, &#x201c;struck with fear at so evil an augury,&#x201d; but William turned the fall to his advantage, holding up handfuls of sand and announcing, &#x201c;I have taken seisin of this land with both my hands.&#x201d; He was borne ashore to hearty acclaim.1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>William soon learned that the English King, Harold, was away in the north, repelling an invasion by King Harold Hardrada of Norway. After defeating and killing Harold Hardrada at Stamford Bridge in Yorkshire, Harold marched south to deal with the Norman threat. On 14 October, the two armies met at Senlac Hill in Sussex, five miles inland from the coast at Hastings, and engaged in a battle that would last for six hours and later become known as the Battle of Hastings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before the fighting began, William addressed his men: &#x201c;I have no doubt of the victory; we are come for glory; the victory is in our hands, and we may make sure of obtaining it if we so please.&#x201d; He fought tirelessly: &#x201c;to see him reining in his horse, shining with sword, helmet and shield, and brandishing his lance, was a pleasant yet terrible sight.&#x201d; It was said that three horses were killed under him that day, but still he fought on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Harold and his men had spread out along the ridge called Senlac Hill, which placed the Normans in the fields below at a disadvantage; but when, at length, on William&#x2019;s order, the Normans staged a retreat, the English made the fatal decision to abandon their strong position and chase after them, at which point the tide of battle turned in William&#x2019;s favor, for without warning the Normans swung around and engaged the English in a fight that quickly turned into a bloodbath. Harold fell, mortally wounded, beneath his standards depicting the Fighting Man and the Gold Dragon of Wessex. Traditionally, he was shot in the eye by an arrow, but that scene in the Bayeux Tapestry also shows a soldier, who may well be Harold, being cut down with axes. His mother and his mistress were able to identify his mutilated body only from secret marks on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The victory was William&#x2019;s, and, in fulfillment of a vow he had made before he sailed, &#x201c;on the very spot where God granted him the conquest of England, he caused a great abbey to be built; and settled monks in it and richly endowed it.&#x201d;2 Here Harold and many others had died, and in the abbey William provided for prayers to be offered in perpetuity for his own sins, for those of his wife Matilda, and for those of the fallen. Today, Battle Abbey stands on the site, although there is very little that remains of William&#x2019;s original foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>William had now to consolidate his victory and establish himself as king, but first he sent his messenger across the sea to Normandy to tell Matilda that she was now, by the grace of God, queen of England.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>part one</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda of Flanders&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Queen of William I</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A Very Beautiful and Noble Girl&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Count Baldwin V of Flanders was famed throughout Christendom as the wisest of men,1 a firm ruler and a precursor of the knights of chivalry&#x2014;-the kind of prince whose friendship was much sought after. He was &#x201c;a man of great power who towered above the rest. Counts, marquises, dukes, even archbishops of the highest dignity were struck dumb with admiration whenever the duty of their office earned them the presence of this distinguished guest. Kings too revered and stood in awe of his greatness.&#x201d;2 He was descended from a powerful and noble family,3 and from the Emperor Charlemagne and England&#x2019;s King Alfred (reigned 871&#x2013;-99); Alfred&#x2019;s daughter Elfrida had married his ancestor Baldwin II.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baldwin ruled one of the greatest territories in northern Europe. He was strong of body, mighty in arms, wise in council, of &#x201c;well--tried integrity&#x201d; and &#x201c;admirable alike for loyalty and wisdom, grey--haired yet with the vigour of youth.&#x201d; Although not at heart a man of war, if he thought a cause was just he would support it wholeheartedly and keep faith with his allies.4 His reputation was such that in 1060 his brother--in--law, Henry I, King of France, would name him regent for his young son Philip.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Baldwin&#x2019;s exalted position owed much to his being the husband of the French King&#x2019;s sister.5 By the pious, strong--willed Adela, the daughter of Robert II, King of France, he had &#x201c;gifted sons and daughters&#x201d;: Baldwin, Robert and Matilda.6 Through the &#x201c;wise and blessed&#x201d; Countess Adela, the children inherited &#x201c;a lineage many times greater even&#x201d; than their father&#x2019;s bloodline.7</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no record of the order in which they were born. Matilda&#x2019;s date of birth is unknown. The earliest possible date&#x2014;-if she was the eldest child&#x2014;-was 1031, her parents having consummated their marriage that year in the face of opposition from her grandfather, Baldwin IV, which was one reason why Baldwin rose against his father soon afterward8 in a rebellion incited by his wife. More likely Matilda was born in 1032 or later. She was connected to most of the ruling houses of Europe: &#x201c;she sprang from the stock of the kings of Gaul and emperors of Germany, and was renowned equally for nobility of blood and character.&#x201d;9</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda grew up at her father&#x2019;s court, which was established mainly in Bruges (or Bryghia, as it was originally known), in the ninth--century castle that served as the administrative center of the counts of Flanders. Built around 850 by Count Baldwin I &#x201c;Iron Arm&#x201d; on the bank of the River Reie, it occupied what is now Burgplatz (Castle Square), and stood next to the contemporary Romanesque church of St. Donatian.10 From Bruges, Baldwin &#x201c;Iron Arm&#x201d; pursued an aggressive expansionist policy to establish the principality of Flanders. Under Matilda&#x2019;s brother, Count Robert the Frisian, Bruges would become its capital. By Matilda&#x2019;s time it was a prosperous center of commerce, and enjoyed &#x201c;very great fame for the number of its inhabitants and for its affluence.&#x201d;11</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda would also have spent time at her father&#x2019;s castle in the Flemish city of Lille. It stood on an island&#x2014;-l&#x2019;Isle, hence the name Lille&#x2014;-in a rural setting on the left bank of the Basse Deule river, with a vineyard to the east. Dating from before 1039, it housed the Chapelle de la Treille, in which the Blessed Virgin was venerated.12 Within the encircling wall and moat there was a donjon, or keep, and the Count&#x2019;s residence, which was called La Salle.13</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Count Baldwin owned other residences in which Matilda would have stayed: a ninth--century wooden castle at Ghent, on the site of which the present Gravensteen&#x2014;-the Castle of the Counts&#x2014;-was built in 1180; a hilltop castle at Th�rouanne, overlooking the cathedral; and the tenth--century &#x201c;bourg&#x201d; at Saint--Omer, which was visited by the court for the observance of holy and feast days.14</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Flanders into which Matilda was born was a turbulent place. &#x201c;Daily homicides and the spilling of human blood troubled the peace and quiet of the entire area.&#x201d; The nobles would urge the bishops to &#x201c;visit the places where this atrocious cruelty especially raged, and to instruct the docile and bloody spirit of the Flemings in the interest of peace and concord.&#x201d;15 But trade and commerce were expanding, ushering in a new era of prosperity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda may have been old enough to be present in 1037 when the exiled Queen of England, Emma of Normandy, widow of King Cnut, was &#x201c;honourably received&#x201d; by Count Baldwin and Countess Adela in Bruges,16 having been driven out of England by her stepson, King Harold Harefoot.17 Baldwin offered Emma a refuge for &#x201c;as long as she had need.&#x201d;18 Now aged about fifty--two, she was to stay at his court, paying her own way, until 1040, when Harold Harefoot died and her own son, Harthacnut, succeeded to the English throne. During this time, the young Matilda may have come to know her, and perhaps been impressed by some rudimentary apprehension of Emma&#x2019;s grandiose and forceful style of English queenship. Emma had wielded political influence and been respected for it; she had used her wealth to patronize scholars. In Bruges, she worked tirelessly for the right of Harthacnut to succeed his half brother. She may also have told Matilda something of Normandy, where she had grown up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When her son became king and Queen Emma finally returned to England, the people of Flanders &#x201c;wept, that she, whom during her whole exile they had regarded as a fellow citizen, was leaving them. Such was the lamentation on the whole shore, such was the wailing of all the people standing by,&#x201d; while &#x201c;a great abundance of tears&#x201d; was shed by Baldwin, Adela and Emma as they said their farewells.19</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The chronicler Orderic Vitalis would one day praise Matilda&#x2019;s intelligence and her learning. The early education of royal children, up to the age of seven, was the responsibility of their mother. Learning was respected at Baldwin&#x2019;s court, and, like her brothers, Matilda was probably taught to read in Latin, although, in common with most high-born children, she was not taught to write. There would always be clerks to do that for her. Much of her tuition would have focused on the Holy Scriptures and the lives of the saints. She may well have read the life of the tenth--century Roman Empress, the highly influential Adelaide of Burgundy, which her mother had commissioned.20 She would have been grounded in needlework and the management of a great household, and had piety instilled into her. This, above all, was an age of faith. The chronicler William of Poitiers, Archdeacon of Lisieux, recorded that Matilda&#x2019;s most praiseworthy quality was &#x201c;a strong faith and fervent love of Christ.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The daughters of kings and lords&#x2014;-who were referred to as princesses, but not so styled until the eighteenth century&#x2014;-were brought up to accept that marriages would be arranged for them, and that it was their duty to render obedience first to their parents and later to their husbands. Marriage was seen as a desirable estate for both sexes, and for many women it defined their role in life. The alternative was the cloister, but it was generally expected that most royal and aristocratic women would marry, and marry well; it was rare to find one who died unwed or unprofessed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The upbringing of high-born girls was therefore geared toward finding a suitable husband, one of fitting rank and standing, and it was incumbent largely upon their mothers to see that their daughters grew up chaste, discreet, humble, pious and obedient, and were prepared for marriage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like most girls, princesses were reared to an awareness that they had been born of an inferior sex, and that consequently their freedoms were limited&#x2014;-although the example of their mothers might have demonstrated that women of rank could be enormously influential. The concept of female inferiority was older than Christianity, but centuries of Christian teaching had rigidly enforced it. Woman was an instrument of the devil, the author of original sin who would lure man away from the path to salvation&#x2014;-in short, the only imperfection in God&#x2019;s creation. Medieval women were regarded variously as weak and passive, or as domineering harridans, temptresses and whores. It was held that young girls needed to be protected from themselves so that they could be nurtured as chaste and submissive maidens and mothers. Marriage was essential to the medieval concept of the divine order of the world: the husband ruled his family, as the King ruled his realm, and as God ruled the universe, and&#x2014;-like subjects&#x2014;-wives were bound in obedience to their husbands and masters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda grew up to be fair, graceful, devout, learned and proud21&#x2014;-&#x201c;a very beautiful and noble girl of royal stock,&#x201d; enthused Duke William of Normandy&#x2019;s chaplain, William of Jumi�ges, who must have met her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the nineteenth century, it was claimed that, according to charters of Lewes Priory, Sussex, the young Matilda was married to Gherbod, advocate of St. Bertin&#x2019;s Abbey in Flanders, and that she bore him a son, Gherbod the Fleming, Earl of Chester, but these charters have since been proved spurious.22</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, there may have been some truth in the later assertion that, &#x201c;when she was a maiden,&#x201d; Matilda &#x201c;loved a count [earl] of England&#x201d; called Brihtric Meaw, whose wealth was said to be surpassed only by that of King Edward the Confessor.23 Rarely in medieval times was royalty associated with romance; until comparatively recently, most royal marriages were the subject of treaties and alliances. In medieval times, marrying for love was regarded as an aberration and irresponsible&#x2014;-and shocking. As the great chronicler William of Malmesbury observed, &#x201c;Kingship and love make sorry bedfellows and sort but ill together.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even if it was merely an accepted fiction, there was some apprehension that love and freedom of choice played their roles in courtship, although they were not allowed to override the more powerful factors at play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brihtric was lord of the extensive honor of Gloucester, an honor being a great feudal lordship comprising dozens or hundreds of manors, held by great magnates (tenants--in--chief) of the Crown. He was a handsome man with snowy white hair, &#x201c;meaw&#x201d; meaning snow in Angl...</p></p><h2>On A Sunbeam</h2><p>One of the youngest ever Eisner winners, incredible talent Tillie Walden presents a stunning queer space opera &#x2013; her greatest work to date.On a Sunbeam is the story of Mia, interwoven between her time as a rebellious schoolgirl at a boarding school in space and her time as crewmember aboard the spacecraft Aktis, where she travels the deepest reaches of space to rebuild and restore beautiful broken-down structures.

But this is only half the story. According to Catherine MacCoun, alchemy is no mere metaphor. It&#x2019;s real magic. Transforming the inner world is, for the alchemist, a way to transform the outer world. Through studying the principles of alchemy, we can achieve extraordinary effects from ordinary actions by understanding how the world really works. We can perceive the hidden connections between the spiritual and the material worlds. Knowledge of these connections enables us to influence external phenomena through the powers of heart and mind alone. Yet alchemy is not, like some forms of magic, the exercise of mind over matter. It is the art of taking what already exists&#x2014;whatever presents itself&#x2014;and transmuting the harmful into the helpful, the useless into the valuable.</p><p><i>On Becoming an Alchemist</i> initiates us into these secrets, showing us how to think, perceive, and operate as an alchemist. It offers practical advice and exercises that will help the modern magician to: <br><br> &#x25cf; Understand and apply basic principles of alchemy <br>&#x25cf; Transmute setbacks, failures, and losses into sources of magical power <br>&#x25cf; Navigate one&#x2019;s inner world with poise, confidence, and common sense <br>&#x25cf; Intuitively show up in the right place at the right time to benefit from magical coincidences <br>&#x25cf; Discover the potentials latent in any situation by awakening subtle perception</p></p><p>Catherine MacCoun is a literary collaborator by profession and has written five published volumes of nonfiction. Her novel, <i>Beyond the Abbey Gates</i>, was originally published as <i>The Age of Miracles</i>, in 1990, and reissued as a Trumpeter book in 2006. She has won numerous grants and awards for her writing, including a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in prose.&#x201c;What MacCoun gives us in her book is a great telling of the workability of magic complete with history, principles, and procedures. She believes that we all have the ability to perform magic, to transform our lives and our world for the better.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Evolve!

The world has witnessed in recent years a rapidly growing interest in St Bridget among Catholics as well as Protestants, and even non-Christians, scholars and the general population alike. Pope John Paul II declared St Bridget Co-Patroness of Europe (1 Oct 1999) and called her a Model for Today&#x2019;s Woman (3 Oct 2002), seeing in her life and in her writings a powerful witness to the Gospel, an "icon" as it were, reflecting the beauty, goodness and loving mercy of God &#x2013; as well as his justice &#x2013; to our modern world in great need, like the Prodigal Son, of coming to its senses and returning to its Father. St Bridget is best known for the Revelations, the divinely inspired messages she received from God the Father, Jesus, the Virgin Mary and numerous saints over a period of almost 30 years. Although the Revelations consist of twelve books and hundreds of pages and treat of a wide variety of subjects, including visions and messages Bridget received regarding the infancy, life and sufferings of Christ which are not found in the gospels, there can also be found throughout the work messages which are of utmost pertinence for today, showing the &#x201c;actuality&#x201d; of St Bridget for the Church and for the world in our times.This collection of Books 1-5 of the Revelations is large, 8"x10" and 418 pages and contains most of the important revelations given to the saint, and it is priced low for wide distribution of these timeless messages which are pertinent to our troubled times as much as -- or probably even more so -- than St Bridget's.See also "The Revelations of St. Bridget and Church Reform," containing some of the most powerful - and often disturbing - revelations taken from all 12 books of the saint's revelations dealing with apostasy and Church reform, beginning with popes, bishops, and priests. The book includes descriptions of God's just punishments for apostasy and immorality, especially by the clergy, and some amazing statements that demons were forced to reveal to St Bridget. The editor has also published "The Revelations of Saint Bridget, Books 11-12, Plus the 15 'Magnificent Prayers' of St Bridget."</p><p>Darrell Wright (editor) received his Licentiate in Philosophy, magnum cum laude from the Angelicum University in Rome and is Co-founder of the Knights of the Holy Rosary.

Developed by the renowned <b>Lockheed Skunk Works</b>, the SR-71 was an awesome aircraft in every respect, setting world records for altitude and speed: an absolute <b>altitude record</b> of 85,069 feet on July 28, 1974, and an absolute <b>speed record</b> of 2,193.2 miles per hour on the same day.<br><br><b>Written by a former Blackbird pilot</b>, <i>SR-71 </i>covers every aspect of the aircraft's development, manufacture, and active service, all lavishly illustrated with <b>more than 200 photos</b>. The SR-71 remained in service with the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to 1998, when it was withdrawn from use, superseded by satellite technology. This authoritative history covers the spylane's entire phenomenal service.</p><p><b>&#x201c;The most feared aircraft of the Cold War had no guns, bombs or missiles . . . it shot pictures!&#x201d;</b><br>&#x2014;Lockheed advertisement&nbsp;Although the development of the SR-71 began over fifty years ago, the iconic Blackbird still looks like a futuristic spaceship. At an altitude of 88,000 feet and wearing pressure suits, its pilots, looking down at the curvature of the Earth from far above any other aircraft, certainly experienced some of what it was like to be an astronaut.&nbsp;&nbsp;The SR-71 had an unrefueled range of 3,500 miles, and its two Pratt and Whitney J-58 turbojets generated 60,000 pounds of thrust while guzzling 8,000 gallons of fuel per hour. Developed by the renowned Lockheed Skunk Works, the aircraft used cutting-edge technology to cope with the high speeds, altitudes, and temperatures to which it was subjected while its cameras took high-resolution images of multiple targets.Twelve of the thirty-two reconnaissance aircraft were destroyed in accidents, but none were lost to enemy action&#x2014;the aircraft was simply too fast and too high up. Throughout its career, the SR-71 was the world&#x2019;s fastest and highest-flying operational manned aircraft, setting a number of world records for altitude and speed. It was in service with the USAF and NASA from 1964 to 1999, when it was withdrawn from use, superseded by satellite technology and cut from tightening budgets.Col. Richard H. Graham, USAF (Ret.), experienced the SR-71 program from many angles&#x2014;pilot, instructor, and wing commander&#x2014;over fifteen years of assignments, and that knowledge and access makes for a comprehensive book, full of insider stories and rare photos and documents. From the precursor aircraft A-12 and FY-12 to the development, manufacture, and service of the SR-71, the legendary Blackbird flies again in <i>SR-71: The Complete Illustrated History of the Blackbird, The World&#x2019;s Highest, Fastest Plane</i>.<br><br><b>Author Bio:</b><br><br>Richard Graham was selected to enter the SR-71 program in 1974 at Beale AFB, California. After several years as a crew member, he became an instructor pilot, and in 1978 he was selected as the chief of the Standardization/Evaluation Division, which included the SR-71, U-2, and T-38 aircraft. In January 1980, he became the SR-71 squadron commander, 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, where he served until his assignment to Air War College, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, in 1981. Graham was a command pilot with more than 4,600 military flying hours. His military decorations and awards include the Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with three oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with eighteen oak leaf clusters, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with &#x201c;V&#x201d; device and one oak leaf cluster, Combat Readiness Medal with one oak leaf cluster, Vietnam Service Medal with four service stars, and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm. Colonel Graham&#x2019;s previous books on the SR-71 include <i>Flying the SR-71 Blackbird</i>, <i>SR-71 Revealed: The Inside Story</i>, and <i>SR-71 Blackbird: Stories, Tales, and Legends</i>. He lives in Plano, Texas.<br><br>At the height of the Cold War in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that Lockheed had developed a strategic reconnaissance aircraft so fast that no other aircraft could catch it. The SR-71 Blackbird flew at over three and a half times the speed of sound&#x2014;more than two thousand miles an hour&#x2014;at 88,000 feet, over sixteen miles up. Snapping photos from three times the height of Everest, pilots had to wear full pressure suits like astronauts.&nbsp;Author Col. Richard H. Graham, USAF (Ret.), was one of those pilots. He also served as an instructor and wing commander for the Blackbird, and he brings all his personal knowledge to <i>SR-71: The Complete Illustrated History of the Blackbird, The World&#x2019;s Highest, Fastest Plane</i>. With more than two hundred images&#x2014;many never before published, including declassified documents&#x2014;<i>SR-71</i> immerses the reader in the design, development, testing, and active service of the aircraft from 1964 to 1999. The inside stories and behind-the-scenes photographs make <i>SR-71</i> an exciting and comprehensive book on the iconic Blackbird.</p><h2>Unequal City: Race, Schools, and Perceptions of Injustice</h2><p><p>Chicago has long struggled with racial residential segregation, high rates of poverty, and deepening class stratification, and it can be a challenging place for adolescents to grow up. <i>Unequal City</i> examines the ways in which Chicago&#x2019;s most vulnerable residents navigate their neighborhoods, life opportunities, and encounters with the law. In this pioneering analysis of the intersection of race, place, and opportunity, sociologist and criminal justice expert Carla Shedd illuminates how schools either reinforce or ameliorate the social inequalities that shape the worlds of these adolescents.<br> <br> Shedd draws from an array of data and in-depth interviews with Chicago youth to offer new insight into this understudied group. Focusing on four public high schools with differing student bodies, Shedd reveals how the predominantly low-income African American students at one school encounter obstacles their more affluent, white counterparts on the other side of the city do not face. Teens often travel long distances to attend school which, due to Chicago&#x2019;s segregated and highly unequal neighborhoods, can involve crossing class, race, and gang lines. As Shedd explains, the disadvantaged teens who traverse these boundaries daily develop a keen &#x201c;perception of injustice,&#x201d; or the recognition that their economic and educational opportunities are restricted by their place in the social hierarchy.<br> <br> Adolescents&#x2019; worldviews are also influenced by encounters with law enforcement while traveling to school and during school hours. Shedd tracks the rise of metal detectors, surveillance cameras, and pat-downs at certain Chicago schools. Along with police procedures like stop-and-frisk, these prison-like practices lead to distrust of authority and feelings of powerlessness among the adolescents who experience mistreatment either firsthand or vicariously. Shedd finds that the racial composition of the student body profoundly shapes students&#x2019; perceptions of injustice. The more diverse a school is, the more likely its students of color will recognize whether they are subject to discriminatory treatment. By contrast, African American and Hispanic youth whose schools and neighborhoods are both highly segregated and highly policed are less likely to understand their individual and group disadvantage due to their lack of exposure to youth of differing backgrounds.</p></p><p>CARLA SHEDD is assistant professor of sociology and African American studies at Columbia University.<p>&#x201c;<i>Unequal City</i> is a revelatory study that shows and tells how inner city young people struggle to acquire a decent education. It powerfully describes the everyday challenges these students face&#x2014;illuminating how they navigate school and their local communities and the way they confront what too often holds them back. This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand the relationship between inequality and urban education.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;Elijah Anderson</b>, William K. Lanman, Jr. Professor of Sociology, Yale University</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Carla Shedd has written an important book about how race and place shape the experiences of young people in Chicago. <i>Unequal City</i> stands out for many reasons, but most importantly for its empirical richness. Shedd has amassed amazing data and uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to amplify the voices of young people. If you want to understand what young people think about such topics as the police, schools, and in-equality, you should read this book. It is a timely and insightful book.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2013;Cathy Cohen</b>, David and Mary Winton Green Professor of Political Science, University of Chicago</p></p><h2>The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity</h2><p><p>"Evil&#x2015;the infliction of pain upon sentient beings&#x2015;is one of the most long-standing and serious problems of human existence.

Jeffrey Burton Russell probes the roots of the idea of evil, treats the development of the idea in the Ancient Near East, and then examines the concept of the Devil as it was formed in late Judaism and early Christianity.</p><p>Generously illustrated with fifty black-and-white photographs, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers, from specialists in religion, theology, sociology, history, psychology, anthropology, and philosophy to anyone with an interest in the demonic, the supernatural, and the question of good and evil.</p></p><p>This lively and learned book traces the history of the concept of evil from its beginnings in ancient times to the period of the New Testament.

His father, who worked for the railroad, had his own dance band in the thirties and appeared on the radio. His mother, also musical, sang in the church choir. So it wasn't surprising when Jim considered playing the viola for a career and received a scholarshipto attend the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. But during an airplane trip he was jerked out of his seat and injured his hand, and that was the end of his musical career.<p>He returned to San AntonioCollege and later Trinity, where he studied French under Harry Allard, his future collaborator. After moving East, Jim graduated from Southern ConnecticutState University with a degree in history and French. The French major somehow wound up trying to teach Spanish in a Catholic school in Boston. Before long he was looking for a new profession.</p><p>On a fateful summer afternoon in 1971 James Marshall lay on his hammock drawing pictures. His mother was inside the house watching <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf </i>on TV. The strident voices of the movie's protagonists, George and Martha, split the quiet air, and as the sketches began to take shape, history was made ... and James Marshall never had to look for another profession.</p><p>And so, with" tongue-in cheek" Jim Marshall began his career and became one of the most prolific and successful author/illustrators of children's books. He is best known for his series on the mischievous exploits of Fox, a debonair, lazy showoff; the uproarious adventures of the two Cut-Ups, Spud and Joe; George and Martha; and the misadventures of the Stupidfamily.</p><p><i>The Washington Post </i> said in a recent review of his work, "There are few better writers and illustrators for children now than Marshall. Certainly there is no one else working today who more successfully captures the child's point of view than does the creator of George and Martha and the Stupids". <i>The New York Times </i> said about the Fox books: "The miracle of Mr.Marshall's work is that so often his stories are as profound as they are simple". He illustrated new versions of many children's classics, including <b>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</b>, for which he received a Caldecott Honor, <b>Red Riding Hood</b>, <b>The Three Little Pigs</b>, and <b>Hansel and Gretel</b>.</p><p>In an interview with <i>Texas Monthly</i>, Jim Marshall said about his work: "People have very oddideas of what a children's writer should be like. Children always expect me to look like a hippopotamus and adults assume that by nature I have to be a little off the wall".</p><p>James Marshall died in October of 1992. He divided his time between an apartment in the Chelsea district of New York and his home in Mansfield Hollow Connecticut.</p><p>copyright ? 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

The automaker built a fleet of turbine cars&#x2014;automobiles with jet engines&#x2014;and lent them out to members of the public. The fleet logged over a million miles; the exercise was a raging success.&nbsp;</p><p>These turbine engines would run on any flammable liquid&#x2014;diesel, heating oil, kerosene, tequila, even Chanel No. 5. If the cars had been mass produced, today we might have cars that do not require petroleum-derived fuels.&nbsp;The engine was also much simpler than the piston engine&#x2014;it contained far fewer moving parts and required much less maintenance. The cars had no radiators or fan belts and never needed oil changes.</p><p>Yet Chrysler crushed and burned most of the cars two years later; the jet car&#x2019;s brief glory was over. Where did it all go wrong? </p><p>Steve Lehto has interviewed all the surviving members of the turbine car program, from the metallurgist who created the exotic metals for the interior of the engine to the test driver who drove it at Chrysler&#x2019;s proving grounds for days on end.

The answer lies in this powerful collection of writings, poems, and sayings by some of the greatest thinkers of the past twenty-five centuries. In succinct original essays, Dyer sets out to explain the meaning and context of each piece of wisdom, and, most important, to explain how we can actively apply these teachings to our modern lives. From sixty ancestral masters &#x2013; Buddha, Michelangelo, Rumi, Whitman, Jesus, Emily Dickinson, and Emerson, among others &#x2013; here are treasured passages on a variety of subjects, including solitude, time, and passion. Among the contributions are words on inspiration from Pantanjali, author of the Hindu classic <em>Yoga Sutras</em>; teachings about the power of prayer from 13th-century monk St. Francis of Assisi; and thoughts about the importance of action written by Mother Teresa.</p><p>The voices collected here cut across a wide range of historical eras and cultures, yet they communicate universal truths about the human experience.&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of the Ages</em>&nbsp;provides us with a marvelous dual opportunity: to receive guidance from our great ancestors and to recognize our own potential for greatness</p></p><p><i>Wisdom of the Ages</i> reads like a workshop on "What the Masters can Teach You." Author Wayne Dyer offers wisdom taught by the world's "great teachers" (such as Buddha, Jesus, Confucius, Michelangelo, and Emily Dickinson) and then provides an easy-to-digest interpretation for modern readers. The book is formatted into daily, quoted passages (around a page in length) from 60 of these teachers--the "60 Days to Enlightenment" in the book's title. After each quote, Dyer offers his own thoughts on how the "lesson" can be applied to contemporary life. After his essay, the author includes a list of exercises to put the teacher's advice to use. Each passage includes a heading--"Soulcenter" for a quote from Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i>, or "Communication" for William Blake's poem "A Poison Tree," for example.<p> While his tone is always reverent, Dyer's interpretations occasionally sound flat and obvious--as if he is dumbing down the language for his audience, rather than elevating readers to a higher consciousness (or at least a higher education). This is a shame, because when Dyer writes with the eloquent and enthusiastic voice that earned him his huge popularity--glimpses of that voice do appear in this book--one sees why so many consider him a "master teacher" in his own right. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>In this inspiring audiobook, bestselling author Wayne W.

Together they pull the plow, spread manure, drive the tractor, pour seeds into a hopper, water twice a day, scare away birds, and drive a combine. The result is a productive day, some beautiful wheat, and an exhausted Stanley. Teamwork has paid off again. Bee's latest Stanley book introduces some rudimentary farming concepts and vocabulary.

An element crystal stolen from a temple, throwing the world into chaos. An unknown country; dangerous, beautiful, wild, magical, unimaginable. A journey almost no one believes that the old woman can undertake. The mysterious dark force bent on total destruction. Seven vastly different cats. One delicate butler. Life can&#x2019;t be over. There&#x2019;s a whole world to save and tea is at four. *As per the viral meme sent out by @yabroodingauthor "It's amazing how many prophecies involve teens. You'd think they'd pick more emotionally stable people, with more free time. Like Grandmas." to which @Dinurial replied, "I would read the hell out of a series of a chosen 85yo woman who goes on epic journeys throughout a dangerous and magical land armed only with a cane and her stab-tastic knitting needles accompanied by her six cats and her skittish-yet-devoted orderly who makes sure she takes her pills on time." WISH GRANTED. Mrs. Alice Perivale is finished with her life. At 73 years old she is told that she is useless to the world and she begins to wonder if it&#x2019;s true, until she meets the most unusual creature she has ever seen, and finds herself in a realm she never could have imagined, on a journey almost no one believes that she can undertake. Against all odds, she accepts the prophesied challenge and she embarks on an adventure to save the strange realm she is in. She must find her way through a bizarre and wild world to take back the Blue Fire Crystal; a powerful and vital gem stolen by a dark force no one has ever seen, hidden away in a palace no one has ever found. She does not go alone. She is accompanied by her seven loyal cats; Tao the Siamese, Sophie the Pampered Princess, Montgomery the Old Gentleman, Bailey the Fat Calico, Jynx the Black, Oscar the Orange Kitten in Training, and Marlowe the Devoted Abyssinian whose place is always at Mrs. Perivale's side. Her delicate butler, Henderson, who has no desire whatsoever for adventure, swallows his fears and chases along after her, obliged to his duty to watch over her, making sure that her pills are taken on time, and tea is served as and when it should be. It is because no one believes she can, that she takes on the challenge, and she must find out for herself whether her life is really over, or if the best of it may be yet to come.

It explores the nature of traumatic exposure, response, processing, and recovery and its impact on constructive theology and pastoral leadership and care. Through the lenses of contemporary traumatology, somatics, and the Internal Family Systems model of psychotherapy, the text offers a framework for seeing trauma and its impact in the lives of individuals, communities, society, and within our own sacred texts. It argues that care of traumatic wounding must include all dimensions of the human person, including our spiritual practices, religious rituals and community participation, and theological thinking. As such, clergy and spiritual care professionals have an important role to play in the recovery of traumatic wounding and fostering of resiliency. This book explores how trauma-informed congregational leaders can facilitate resiliency and offers one way of thinking theologically in response to traumatizing abuses of relational power and our resources for restoration.</p><p>Jennifer Baldwin is Executive Director of Grounding Flight Wellness Center.

Yet, for author Kevin Hines the bridge is not merely a marker of a place or a time. Instead, the bridge marks the beginning of his remarkable story. At 19 years old, Kevin attempted to take his own life by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge - a distance which took four seconds to fall. Recently diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, Kevin had begun to hear voices telling him he had to die, and days before his attempt, he began to believe them.<br><br>The fall would break his body, but not his spirit. His story chronicles the extraordinary will of the author to live mentally well in the face of his mental illness: bipolar disorder with psychotic features. With each mental breakdown, however, the author&#x2019;s desire to live mentally well-- and to be a mental health advocate-- pulls him from the depths of his condition. Kevin&#x2019;s story is a remarkable testament to the strength of the human spirit and a reminder to us to love the life we have. His story also reminds us that living mentally well takes time, endurance, hard work, and support. With these disciplines in place, those living with even very difficult diagnoses can achieve better lives for themselves and those who help to support and care for them.</p><p>Kevin Hines is an award-winning international speaker, author, and mental health advocate. <br>Kevin has been featured in the critically acclaimed film &#x201c;The Bridge,&#x201d; on Larry King Live, 20/20, Anderson Cooper 360, Good Morning America, and Ireland&#x2019;s famed Tonight with Vincent Browne.

He was most recently honored as a Lifetime Achievement Award Winner by The National Council for Community Behavioral Health.At age 19, Hines nearly became one of the more than 2,000 people who have jumped to their deaths from the Golden Gate Bridge since it was built in 1937. Fortunately, however, Hines become part of a much better statistic: he is the 26th person known to have survived the 220-foot fall. The first-time author also found a reason for living after years of suffering without help from 'bipolar disorder 1 with psychotic features.' Now a well-known mental-health advocate, Hines presents a vivid and moving memoir of how he descended into mental breakdown, fought to overcome his demons with the help of family and medical experts, and has made it his 'life&#x2019;s work to educate people all over this great country, and around the globe, to prevent suicide and understand mental illness.' Hines doesn&#x2019;t go easy on the reader&#x2014;he harrowingly describes his extreme paranoia, deep depressions, manic highs, hallucinations, and panic attacks.

A must-read for anyone who's ever wanted to know about living with mental illness. (Linda Rosenberg, MSW, president and CEO, National Council for Behavioral Helath)<br><br>I've had the pleasure of knowing Kevin Hines for nearly a decade now, since that time as a Los Angeles Times reporter in San Francisco when I went looking to profile someone who had jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge -- and survived. Not only did I find my man, but that young man changed my life. And became my friend. I spent time with Kevin. I trailed him to speaking engagements, accompanied him to the site where he jumped off that bridge as a troubled kid. I met his Dad and his now-wife Margie. I attended their wedding and have had dinner at their home. I have seen Kevin mature into a man, a young author and speaker, with a message to people in the Bay Area and across the nation: Suicide isn't the answer. Cracked, Not Broken should be required reading in Bay Area schools and for anyone else who wants to follow in the footsteps of a person with bipolar disorder who has emerged triumphant. (John M. Glionna, national reporter, Los Angeles Times)<br><br>Kevin&#x2019;s remarkable story of resilience and courage provides keen insight into the intense ambivalence experienced by those who struggle with thoughts of suicide. It is tragic to think about the hundreds who may have similarly wished like Kevin to be back on the bridge immediately after jumping. However, it is also extremely hopeful that lives can be saved even when someone is truly intent on ending their pain. Cracked, Not Broken proclaims, &#x201c;suicide is not inevitable for anyone&#x201d; and that belief is strengthening commitment to suicide prevention everywhere from the Golden Gate Bridge to the US healthcare system.

He has a whole bagful of grudging excuses for wishing to ignore Caroline&#39;s call, and one compelling reason to drop everything: guilt. His daughter Berry has become the object of desire of a co-worker, a madman and genius with a penchant for puzzles and games who had spent the past year making Berry&#39;s life hell, and who now has vowed to kill her. The heart-pounding situation goes from bad to worse when the stalker begins to claim other victims and leaves an ominous trail of clues as he lethally works his way toward Berry. From the acclaimed international bestselling author Sandra Brown, Tough Customer, is a thrilling tale about obsession and murder, the fragile nature of relationships, and, possibly, second chances.</p><p>Sandra Brown is the author of fifty-six New York Times bestsellers, most recently PLAY DIRTY which was published in August 2007 by Simon &amp; Schuster and debuted at number two on the New York Times hardcover fiction bestseller list.

She is much in demand as a speaker at book festivals and charity functions throughout the year.Brown&#x2019;s latest thriller reintroduces a character from her previous outing, Smash Cut (2009): Dodge Hanley, a grizzled investigator who used to be a cop. Dodge is awakened one morning by a call from Caroline King, a woman he hasn&#x2019;t seen in 30 years&#x2014;since the day their daughter, Berry, was born. Now Berry is the target of a frightening stalker who has just broken into Caroline&#x2019;s house and shot Berry&#x2019;s coworker, Ben Lofland. Dodge reluctantly agrees to travel from Atlanta to Texas to help the police hunt down Berry&#x2019;s tormentor, the vengeful Oren Starks. The police deputy on the case, Ski Nyland, is suspicious of Berry and convinced she is hiding something. As Dodge works with Ski to track Oren, his feelings for Caroline resurface, and he recalls how they first met&#x2014;and the reason their torrid relationship came to an end. Though a late-in-the-game twist seems somewhat farfetched, the draw here is the appealing Dodge, a character Brown fans will have no problem rooting for. --Kristine Huntley</p><h2>Enough</h2><p><p>What is our motivation for serving Jesus? Is it so that we might have good health and be wealthy? Galatians 1 tells us that the wealth and health prosperity gospel is no gospel at all! However what we can find is fullness in Christ and in him we find that indeed God is enough for us! This easy to read book addresses key themes that span global cultures. It counters the view that material abundance is the sign of God&#x2019;s blessing and that poverty is a sign of God&#x2019;s curse.

Carl Trueman wrestles with those two provocative questions and concludes that modern evangelicals emphasize experience and activism at the expense of theology. Their minds go fuzzy as they downplay doctrine. The result is "a world in which everyone from Joel Osteen to Brian McLaren to John MacArthur may be called an evangelical."<br><br>Fifteen years ago in <i>The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</i>, historian Mark Noll warned that evangelical Christians had abandoned the intellectual aspects of their faith. Christians were neither prepared nor inclined to enter intellectual debates, and had become culturally&nbsp;marginalized. Trueman argues that&nbsp;today&nbsp;"religious beliefs are more scandalous than they have been for many years"--but for different reasons than Noll foresaw. In fact, the real problem now is exactly the opposite of what Noll diagnosed: evangelicals don't lack a mind, but rather an agreed upon evangel. Although known as gospel people, evangelicals no longer share any consensus on the gospel's meaning. <br><br>Provocative and persuasive, Trueman's indictment of evangelicalism also suggests a better way forward for those theologically conservative Protestants&nbsp;famously known as evangelicals.</p></p><p><b>CARL R. TRUEMAN</b> studied at the Universities of Cambridge and Aberdeen in the United Kingdom. Prior to emigrating to the United States, he was on faculty at the University of Nottingham and King's College, University of Aberdeen.

Carl Trueman intends to reshape<br>that entire question, and he does so by questioning the very existence<br>of evangelicalism. In this clever book, Trueman forces us all to<br>think about themost basic issues of evangelical identity, integrity, and<br>credibility. This work comes froma first-rate evangelical scholar.

ALBERT MOHLER JR. </b>President and Joseph Emerson Brown,<br>Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br></p><p>Professor Trueman offers a clear and sober assessment of contemporary<br>evangelicalism and how its doctrinal neglect as well as its ecclesial<br>and institutional practices continue to sever its intellectual and<br>moral life from its biblical and theological roots. As a Catholic, I part<br>ways with Professor Trueman on several doctrinal questions. But<br>when it comes to our common heritage as Christians&#x2014;and our shared<br>understanding of the good, the true, and the beautiful&#x2014;I stand with<br>him against a spirit of the age that will not rest until all the vestiges<br>of Christian civilization are vanquished from the face of the Earth.<br>What is truly tragic&#x2014;as Professor Trueman forcefully argues&#x2014;<br>is that some who claim to be allies of that civilization, as well as<br>friends of all things &#x201c;evangelical,&#x201d; embrace and propagate ideas that<br>aid and abet its destruction.

The air was cool now, laced with light rain, heavy with the fecund smell of wet humus, night-blooming jasmine, roses, and new bamboo. I was about to stop my truck at Del&#x2019;s and pick up three crawfish dinners to go when a lavender Cadillac fishtailed out of a side street, caromed off a curb, bounced a hubcap up on a sidewalk, and left long serpentine lines of tire prints through the glazed pools of yellow light from the street lamps.<br> <br>I was off duty, tired, used up after a day of searching for a nineteen-year-old girl in the woods, then finding her where she had been left in the bottom of a coulee, her mouth and wrists wrapped with electrician&#x2019;s tape. Already I had tried to stop thinking about the rest of it. The medical examiner was a kind man. He bagged the body before any news people or family members got there.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t like to bust drunk drivers. I don&#x2019;t like to listen to their explanations, watch their pitiful attempts to affect sobriety, or see the sheen of fear break out in their eyes when they realize they&#x2019;re headed for the drunk tank with little to look forward to in the morning except the appearance of their names in the newspaper. Or maybe in truth I just don&#x2019;t like to see myself when I look into their faces.<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t believe this particular driver could make it another block without ripping the side off a parked car or plowing the Cadillac deep into someone&#x2019;s shrubbery. I plugged my portable bubble into the cigarette lighter, clamped the magnets on the truck&#x2019;s roof, and pulled him to the curb in front of the Shadows, a huge brick, white-columned antebellum home built on Bayou Teche in 1831.<br> <br>I had my Iberia Parish Sheriff&#x2019;s Department badge opened in my palm when I walked up to his window.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I see your driver&#x2019;s license, please?&#x201d;<br> <br>He had rugged good looks, a Roman profile, square shoulders, and broad hands. When he smiled I saw that his teeth were capped. The woman next to him wore her hair in blond ringlets and her body was as lithe, tanned, and supple-looking as an Olympic swimmer&#x2019;s. Her mouth looked as red and vulnerable as a rose. She also looked like she was seasick.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want driver&#x2019;s what?&#x201d; he said, trying to focus evenly on my face. Inside the car I could smell a drowsy, warm odor, like the smell of smoke rising from a smoldering pile of wet leaves.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your driver&#x2019;s license,&#x201d; I repeated. &#x201c;Please take it out of your billfold and hand it to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, sure, wow,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I was really careless back there. I&#x2019;m sorry about that. I really am.&#x201d;<br> <br>He got his license out of his wallet, dropped it in his lap, found it again, then handed it to me, trying to keep his eyes from drifting off my face. His breath smelled like fermented fruit that had been corked up for a long time in a stone jug.<br> <br>I looked at the license under the street lamp.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Elrod T. Sykes?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, that&#x2019;s who I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you step out of the car, Mr. Sykes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, anything you say.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was perhaps forty, but in good shape. He wore a light-blue golf shirt, loafers, and gray slacks that hung loosely on his flat stomach and narrow hips. He swayed slightly and propped one hand on the door to steady himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have a problem here, Mr. Sykes. I think you&#x2019;ve been smoking marijuana in your automobile.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Marijuana . . . Boy, that&#x2019;d be bad, wouldn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think your lady friend just ate the roach, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That wouldn&#x2019;t be good, no, sir, not at all.&#x201d; He shook his head profoundly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re going to let the reefer business slide for now. But I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re under arrest for driving while intoxicated.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very bad news. This definitely was not on my agenda this evening.&#x201d; He widened his eyes and opened and closed his mouth as though he were trying to clear an obstruction in his ear canals. &#x201c;Say, do you recognize me? What I mean is, there&#x2019;re news people who&#x2019;d really like to put my ham hocks in the frying pan. Believe me, sir, I don&#x2019;t need this. I cain&#x2019;t say that enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to drive you just down the street to the city jail, Mr. Sykes. Then I&#x2019;ll send a car to take Ms. Drummond to wherever she&#x2019;s staying. But your Cadillac will be towed to the pound.&#x201d;<br> <br>He let out his breath in a long sigh. I turned my face away.<br> <br>&#x201c;You go to the movies, huh?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I always enjoyed your films. Ms. Drummond&#x2019;s, too. Take your car keys out of the ignition, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; he said, despondently.<br> <br>He leaned into the window and pulled the keys out of the ignition.<br> <br>&#x201c;El, do something,&#x201d; the woman said.<br> <br>He straightened his back and looked at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel real bad about this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Can I make a contribution to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or something like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>In the lights from the city park, I could see the rain denting the surface of Bayou Teche.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Sykes, you&#x2019;re under arrest. You can remain silent if you wish, or if you wish to speak, anything you say can be used against you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;As a long-time fan of your work, I recommend that you not say anything else. Particularly about contributions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t look like you mess around. Were you ever a Texas ranger? They don&#x2019;t mess around, either. You talk back to those boys and they&#x2019;ll hit you upside the head.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we don&#x2019;t do that here,&#x201d; I said. I put my hand under his arm and led him to my truck. I opened the door for him and helped him inside. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to get sick in my truck, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sir, I&#x2019;m just fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good. I&#x2019;ll be right with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I walked back to the Cadillac and tapped on the glass of the passenger&#x2019;s door. The woman, whose name was Kelly Drummond, rolled down the window. Her face was turned up into mine. Her eyes were an intense, deep green. She wet her lips, and I saw a smear of lipstick on her teeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to wait here about ten minutes, then someone will drive you home,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Officer, I&#x2019;m responsible for this,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We were having an argument. Elrod&#x2019;s a good driver. I don&#x2019;t think he should be punished because I got him upset. Can I get out of the car? My neck hurts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suggest you lock your automobile and stay where you are, Ms. Drummond. I also suggest you do some research into the laws governing the possession of narcotics in the state of Louisiana.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow, I mean, it&#x2019;s not like we hurt anybody. This is going to get Elrod in a lot of trouble with Mikey. Why don&#x2019;t you show a little compassion?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mikey?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Our director, the guy who&#x2019;s bringing about ten million dollars into your little town. Can I get out of the car now? I really don&#x2019;t want a neck like Quasimodo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can go anywhere you want. There&#x2019;s a pay phone in the poolroom you can use to call a bondsman. If I were you, I wouldn&#x2019;t go down to the station to help Mr. Sykes, not until you shampoo the Mexican laughing grass out of your hair.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Boy, talk about wearing your genitalia outside your pants. Where&#x2019;d they come up with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I walked back to my truck and got in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, maybe I can be a friend of the court,&#x201d; Elrod Sykes said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that what they call it? There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with that, is there? Man, I can really do without this bust.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Few people standing before a judge ever expected to be there,&#x201d; I said, and started the engine.<br> <br>He was quiet while I made a U-turn and headed for the city police station. He seemed to be thinking hard about something. Then he said: &#x201c;Listen, I know where there&#x2019;s a body. I saw it. Nobody&#x2019;d pay me any mind, but I saw the dadburn thing. That&#x2019;s a fact.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You saw what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A colored, I mean a black person, it looked like. Just a big dry web of skin, with bones inside it. Like a big rat&#x2019;s nest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where was this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Out in the Atchafalaya swamp, about four days ago. We were shooting some scenes by an Indian reservation or something. I wandered back in these willows to take a leak and saw it sticking out of a sandbar.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you didn&#x2019;t bother to report it until now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told Mikey. He said it was probably bones that had washed out of an Indian burial mound or something. Mikey&#x2019;s kind of hard-nosed. He said the last thing we needed was trouble with either cops or university archaeologists.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it tomorrow, Mr. Sykes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t pay me much mind, either. But that&#x2019;s all right. I told you what I saw. Y&#x2019;all can do what you want to with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked straight ahead through the beads of water on the window. His handsome face was wan, tired, more sober now, resigned perhaps to a booking room, drunk-tank scenario he knew all too well. I remembered two or three wire-service stories about him over the last few years&#x2014;a brawl with a couple of cops in Dallas or Fort Worth, a violent ejection from a yacht club in Los Angeles, and a plea on a cocaine-possession bust. I had heard that bean sprouts, mineral water, and the sober life had become fashionable in Hollywood. It looked like Elrod Sykes had arrived late at the depot.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I didn&#x2019;t get your name,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dave Robicheaux.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you see, Mr. Robicheaux, a lot of people don&#x2019;t believe me when I tell them I see things. But the truth is, I see things all the time, like shadows moving around behind a veil. In my family we call it &#x2018;touched.&#x2019; When I was a little boy, my grandpa told me, &#x2018;Son, the Lord done touched you. He give you a third eye to see things that other people cain&#x2019;t. But it&#x2019;s a gift from the Lord, and you mustn&#x2019;t never use it otherwise.&#x2019; I haven&#x2019;t ever misused the gift, either, Mr. Robicheaux, even though I&#x2019;ve done a lot of other things I&#x2019;m not proud of. So I don&#x2019;t care if people think I lasered my head with too many recreational chemicals or not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was quiet again. We were almost to the jail now. The wind blew raindrops out of the oak trees, and the moon edged the storm clouds with a metallic silver light. He rolled down his window halfway and breathed in the cool smell of the night.<br> <br>&#x201c;But if that was an Indian washed out of a burial mound instead of a colored man, I wonder what he was doing with a chain wrapped around him,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I slowed the truck and pulled it to the curb.<br> <br>&#x201c;Say that again,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was a rusted chain, I mean with links as big as my fist, crisscrossed around his rib cage.&#x201d;<br> <br>I studied his face. It was innocuous, devoid of intention, pale in the moonlight, already growing puffy with hangover.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want some slack on the DWI for your knowledge about this body, Mr. Sykes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sir, I just wanted to tell you what I saw. I shouldn&#x2019;t have been driving. Maybe you kept me from having an accident.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some people might call that jailhouse humility. What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you might make a tough film director.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you find that sandbar again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, I believe I can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you and Ms. Drummond staying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The studio rented us a house out on Spanish Lake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to make a confession to you, Mr. Sykes. DWIs are a pain in the butt. Also I&#x2019;m on city turf and doing their work. If I take y&#x2019;all home, can I have your word you&#x2019;ll remain there until tomorrow morning?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, you sure can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I want you in my office by nine A.M.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nine A.M. You got it. Absolutely. I really appreciate this.&#x201d;<br> <br>The transformation in his face was immediate, as though liquified ambrosia had been infused in the veins of a starving man. Then as I turned the truck around in the middle of the street to pick up the actress whose name was Kelly Drummond, he said something that gave me pause about his level of sanity.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does anybody around here ever talk about Confederate soldiers out on that lake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just what I said. Does anybody ever talk about guys in gray or butternut-brown uniforms out there? A bunch of them, at night, out there in the mist.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t y&#x2019;all making a film about the War Between the States? Are you talking about actors?&#x201d; I looked sideways at him. His eyes were straight forward, focused on some private thought right outside the windshield.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, these guys weren&#x2019;t actors,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d been shot up real bad. They looked hungry, too. It happened right around here, didn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The battle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m not following you, Mr. Sykes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Up ahead I saw Kelly Drummond walking in her spiked heels and Levi&#x2019;s toward Tee Neg&#x2019;s poolroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, you do,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You believe when most people don&#x2019;t, Mr. Robicheaux. You surely do. And when I say you believe, you know exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked confidently, serenely, into my face and winked with one blood-flecked eye.</p><h2>Hellboy Library Edition, Volume 6: The Storm and The Fury and The Bride of Hell (Hellboy (Dark Horse Library))</h2><p>The oversized Hellboy hardcover series continues, collecting the climatic &#34;Death of Hellboy&#34; storyline from Mike Mignola and Duncan Fegredo, and one-shots by some of the greatest talents in comics!

This is a practical guide for mothers who are experiencing postpartum depression and anxiety. The book is based on the experiences of thousands of women and describes what has helped them get through this difficult time. </b></p> <p> <b>From the introduction:</b><br> The idea for this book came from the realization that many women are suffering from some degree of postpartum depression and that very few will find access to supportive care while going through it. Some of our own mothers are only now feeling safe enough to talk about their experiences and describe how alone and crazy they felt. The material in this book is based on over thirty years of counselling thousands of women with postpartum depression. These women have willingly shared their experiences with each other, and together they have explored what has helped them. It is their knowledge, wisdom, courage and generosity that has made this book possible. Emphasis has been put on those common threads which run through the experience of postpartum depression. The term &#x201c;perinatal depression&#x201d; is being used to describe postpartum depression in many newer research, journals and publications. It is an umbrella term that better reflects the fact that symptoms can begin during pregnancy as well as postpartum. In this book we refer to &#x201c;postpartum depression&#x201d;, which fits under the more general category of &#x201c;perinatal&#x201d; symptoms. As you read, keep in mind that you are going to survive this. However hopeless you may feel, try to remember that it will end. Women grow and change as they cope with their depression. After it is all over, many women say they are glad they went through the experience. As one woman said, &#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d get through it but I did and I feel great. I know much more about myself. Now I enjoy my baby and I feel peaceful.&#x201d;</p></p><p>PPPSS is a not-for-profit society which provides support to women and families experiencing depression or anxiety related to the birth or adoption of a baby.

At least, that was the going rate at the Polo Grounds when a Yankee fan named Guy Clarke snagged one in the left-field bleachers, got arrested for refusing to return it, and had to pay a $3 fine. That was a lot of money back then, but we're not talking about any old ball. It was a ninth-inning home run hit by Yankees shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh against the Boston Red Sox. Considering what that ball would sell for today, it was totally worth it. The editors at the <i>New York Times</i>, however, didn't see it that way, and on May 8, 1915&#x2014;one day after the incident&#x2014;the paper ran a short article called "Ball Grabbers, Read This." It was a warning, and the message was clear: if you steal a baseball, you're gonna get busted.<br><br>This was old news.<br><br>And it wasn't entirely true.<br><br>Clarke was just one of the unlucky few who got prosecuted; fans had been snapping up baseballs for years, and by 1915 more than two dozen balls were disappearing at the Polo Grounds each week. Yeah, these balls were expensive&#x2014;owners were paying $15 per dozen&#x2014;but beyond the financial burden, it didn't really matter. If a few balls were lost here and there, the home plate umpire simply replaced them.<br><br>That's not how things worked when the National League formed in 1876. High-quality balls were so scarce that each one was expected to last an entire game, and if the ball went missing, the players went looking for it. As a result, fans policed themselves whenever a ball landed in the crowd and made sure that it was returned. It had to be. There was no room for debate. But when foul balls flew completely over the grandstand and landed outside the ballpark, they were much harder to recover. These balls were often grabbed by little kids who didn't have enough money to buy tickets, so teams came up with a solution: anyone who returned a ball got to watch the game for free.<br><br>This reward system was effective at first, but kids eventually began to value the ball more than the opportunity to watch grown men play with it. (Can you blame them?) On June 1, 1887, <i>Toronto World</i> reported that "fifteen balls were knocked over the left field fence at Buffalo Monday and were stolen by bad boys." In other words, teams weren't just losing balls during games; kids were taking them during batting practice as well. What began as a nuisance&#x2014;a missing ball every once in a while&#x2014;was turning into an epidemic.<br><br>On May 1, 1897, <i>The Sporting News</i> declared that "the souvenir craze" was affecting games in the South. In 1899 the Washington Senators hired a group of boys to retrieve baseballs. By 1901 teams were spending so much money on balls that the National League Rules Committee suggested penalizing batters who fouled off good pitches. On May 2, 1902, the <i>Detroit Free Press</i> said, "Baseballs that go into the stands at St. Louis are hopelessly lost, the man who first gets his hands on the flying sphere clinging to it." Sometime around 1903, it was rumored that on one occasion when a fan at the Polo Grounds refused to return a ball, John McGraw, the Hall of Fame manager of the New York Giants, retaliated by stealing the guy's hat.<br><br>Major League Baseball took action the following season by officially giving teams the right to retrieve balls that were hit into the stands. This new measure worked in some cases, but for the most part all it did was piss off the fans and make them more determined than ever not to cooperate.<br><br>In 1905 a Cubs fan named Samuel Scott was arrested in Chicago after catching a foul ball and refusing to hand it over to an usher. Cubs president James Hart personally confronted him and signed a larceny complaint, but the charges were dropped the next day when Scott, a member of the Board of Trade, threatened to sue for assault and false arrest.<br><br>Things got progressively worse from there.<br><br>"Brooklynites seem to prize highly balls which go into the bleachers," reported the <i>New York Tribune</i> in 1908.<br><br>"Women are as bad as men about stealing baseballs; they aren't so skillful in hiding them," said baseball manufacturer Tom Shibe in 1911.<br><br>"The practice of concealing balls fouled into the grandstand or bleachers has reached disgusting proportions in New York," claimed <i>Sporting Life</i> magazine in 1915.<br><br>Cubs owner Charles Weeghman felt otherwise. He recognized the foul ball frenzy as a business opportunity&#x2014;a chance to bring more folks to the ballpark&#x2014;and on April 29, 1916, he began letting fans keep the foul balls they caught. Two and a half months later, the Phillies' business manager billed Weeghman for eight baseballs that were hit into the stands during BP, but that was the price of good PR. The October 1916 issue of Baseball magazine praised Weeghman in a lengthy staff editorial. "The charm of novelty, of possible gain might lure far more spectators than enough to pay for the lost balls," it said. "At any rate, Mr. Weeghman evidently thinks so. For he has recently inaugurated this common-sense policy in his park at Chicago."<br><br>Other owners just didn't get it.<br><br>"Why should a man carry away an object worth $2.50 just because he gets his hands on it?" asked Colonel "Cap" Huston, part-owner of the Yankees. "When people go to a restaurant, do they take the dishes or silverware home for souvenirs?"<br><br>Most teams generously donated used balls to servicemen during World War I, but continued bullying the regular fans.<br><br>Enter Reuben Berman.<br><br>On May 16, 1921, Berman, a 31-year-old stockbroker from Connecticut, caught a foul ball during a Reds-Giants game at the Polo Grounds,and when the ushers demanded that he return it, he responded by tossing it deeper into the crowd. Berman was whisked away by security personnel, taken to the team offices, threatened with arrest, and ejected from the stadium. Giants management figured that was the end of it, but nearly three months later Berman's attorney served the team with legal papers, claiming that his client had been unlawfully detained and had suffered mental anguish and a loss of reputation. The case was tried in New York's Supreme Court, and Berman was awarded $100&#x2014;far less than the $20,000 sum originally sought by his attorney, but the message was delivered.<br><br>"Reuben's Rule" (as it came to be known) was the real turning point, although change didn't happen all at once. Several owners still refused to give in, and as a result, there were a few more high-profile clashes between fans and security personnel. The most outrageous incident took place in 1923, when an 11-year-old boy named Robert Cotter was arrested and thrown in jail for pocketing a ball at the Baker Bowl in Philadelphia. The following day he was released by a sympathetic judge who said, "Such an act on the part of a boy is merely proof that he is following his most natural impulses. It is a thing I would do myself."<br><br>Seven years later in Chicago, with Weeghman long gone as Cubs owner, there was another ugly incident involving a young fan. Arthur Porto, age 17, caught a Hack Wilson foul ball and brawled with stadium security when they tried to take it from him. He and his two friends, who had joined the scuffle, were booked for disorderly conduct. The next day in court the judge dismissed the charges and ruled that a ball hit into the crowd belongs "to the boy who grabs it."<br><br>There were still a few more altercations in the 1930s,and during World War II teams once again donated balls to the armed forces.During that time fans were asked to return whatever they snagged, but that was the end of it. Ballhawking bliss, along with a whole new set of controversies, was about to begin.<br><br><b>STEVE BARTMAN</b><br><br>Steve Bartman is responsible for the biggest ball-related controversy in history. Most sports fans know his name, but few are aware of the entire wacky aftermath. The original incident occurred on October 13,2003&#x2014;Game 6 of the National League Championship Series at Wrigley Field. It was the top of the eighth inning. One out. Runner on second base. The Cubs were beating the Marlins, 3-0, and needed just five more outs to advance to the World Series. They hadn't been there since 1945. They hadn't won it since 1908.Momentum was finally on their side-until Luis Castillo lofted a seemingly harmless fly ball down the left-field line. Cubs left fielder Moises Alou ran into foul territory and probably would've made the catch had a certain fan not reached out of the stands and deflected it.<br><br>That fan was Steve Bartman.<br><br>Alou flung his glove in disgust, and the crowd direct edits wrath at Bartman, who had to be escorted out by stadium security for hisown safety. When play resumed, the Marlins rallied for eight runs and put the game away.<br><br>Poor Bartman. Not only did half a dozen police cars have to gather outside his home that night to protect him and his family, but things got worse the next day after the Cubs blew their lead in Game 7 and failed to reach the World Series. Bartman became an instant scapegoat for generations of disgruntled Cubs fans, received death threats, had to change his phone number,and was forced into hiding. Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich suggested that he enter the witness protection program, while Florida governor Jeb Bush offered him asylum. Bartman proceeded to turn down interview requests and endorsement deals, and he eventually rejected a $25,000 offer to autograph a photo of himself at a sports memorabilia convention.<br><br>Here's where it gets weird.<br><br>Several months later, a successful restaurateur named Grant DePorter bought the infamous foul ball at an auction for $113,824. DePorter, hoping to rid the Cubs of their curse, recruited Michael Lantieri, an Academy Award-winning special effects expert, to blow up the ball at Harry Caray's restaurant. The stunt was covered live on CNN, ESPN, and MSNBC and was written up by more than 4,000 newspapers. Then, a year later, at a much less publicized event, DePorter used the remnants of the ball to make a dish he named "Foul Ball Spaghetti." What remained of the ball was boiled; the steam was captured and distilled and added to the recipe.<br><b><br>JEFFREY MAIER</b><br><br>Jeffrey Maier was the most infamous baseball fan before Bartman, and he attained his notoriety by doing the same thing: reaching out of the stands and interfering with a ball that was still in play. Luckily for Maier, who was just 12 years old at the time, he was treated as a hero because his interference happened to help the home team. And not just any team&#x2014;the New York Yankees.<br><br>It was October 9, 1996&#x2014;Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. The Yankees were trailing the Baltimore Orioles, 4-3, with one out in the bottom of the eighth, when Derek Jeter spanked a deep drive toward the short porch in right field. Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco reached the blue padded wall as the ball was descending and leaped to make the catch&#x2014;but he never got the chance because Maier stuck out his glove and deflected the ball back into the stands. Right-field umpire Rich Garcia ruled it a home run, prompting Tarasco and Orioles manager Davey Johnson to argue like mad. And they were right&#x2014;slow-motion replays indicated that the ball would not have cleared the wall if not for Maier&#x2014;but the bad call stood, and the Yankees won the game (and eventually the World Series) in extra innings. The Orioles filed an official protest, and even though Garcia admitted that there was fan interference, the protest was denied by American League president Gene Budig. Maier appeared on national talk shows and was given the key to New York City by Mayor Rudy Giuliani.<br><br><b>RED SOX WORLD SERIES BALLS</b><br><br>When Red Sox first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz caught the final out of the 2004 World Series, he found an extra way to get his name in the papers: by deciding to keep the ball for himself. Mientkiewicz, a former Gold Glove winner who had entered the game as a defensive replacement for David Ortiz in the bottom of the seventh, felt that he deserved to keep it since he caught it. Red Sox fans and management disagreed. Their team had finally overcome "the Curse of the Bambino" and won its first championship in 86 years. In their minds, this was one of the most important balls in the history of the sport, and it belonged in the team's museum. Mientkiewicz held out, and as the negative media attention intensified, he joked to a Boston Globe reporter that the ball was his "retirement fund." Or was he joking? On the same day he caught it, Barry Bonds's 700th career home run ball sold for $804,129 through an online auction.<br><br>How did the Mientkiewicz saga end? It was easy. First the Red Sox traded him to the Mets for a minor leaguer. Then they filed a lawsuit against him. Then they dropped the charges when he agreed to let an independent mediator settle the dispute. Finally he lent the ball to the Sox for a year and then donated it to the Hall of Fame.<br><br>When Boston won the World Series again in 2007, a whole new controversy erupted over the final-out ball. This time it ended up in the hands of catcher Jason Varitek, who initially said he planned to return it to the team, but later admitted that he gave it to reliever Jonathan Papelbon. When the team asked Papelbon for the ball, he claimed that his dog ate it.<br><br>&nbsp;"He plays with baseballs like they are his toys," said the pitcher of his bulldog, Boss. "He jumped up one day on the counter and snatched it. He likes rawhide. He tore that thing to pieces."<br><br>Papelbon vowed to keep what was left of the ball, but later told the New England Sports Network that he'd thrown it out. "It's in the garbage in Florida somewhere," he said.<br><br>Team officials took his word and did not file charges.</p><h2>Parish Priest: Father Michael McGivney and American Catholicism</h2><p><p> Is now the time for an American parish priest to be declared a Catholic saint? </p> <p> Born and raised in a Connecticut factory town, the son of Irish immigrants, Father Michael McGivney's (1852-1890) legacy of hope is still celebrated around the world. At a time when discrimination against American Catholics, homelessness, and starvation were widespread, Father McGivney founded the Knights of Columbus, an organization that has helped save countless families from the indignity of destitution. </p> <p> In this moving and inspirational work, Douglas Brinkley, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Great Deluge</i> and <i>The Boys of Pointe du Hoc</i>, and award-winning author Julie M. Fenster re-create the all-too-brief life of perhaps the most beloved parish priest in U.S. history and chronicle the process of canonization that may well make this fiercely dynamic yet tenderhearted man the first American-born priest to be declared a saint by the Vatican. </p></p><p><p>Douglas Brinkley is the Katherine Tsanoff Brown Chair in Humanities and Professor of History at Rice University, a CNN Presidential Historian, and a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair</em>.&nbsp; In the world of public history, he serves on boards, at museums, at colleges, and for historical societies.

Fenster is an award-winning author and historian, specializing in the American story. In 2006 her book <em>Parish Priest</em>, written with coauthor Douglas Brinkley, was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller for seven weeks. She also wrote <em>Ether Day: The Strange Tale of America's Greatest Medical Discovery and the Haunted Men Who Made It</em>, which won the prestigious Anesthesia Foundation Award for Best Book. Fenster is the author of six other books, including <em>Race of the Century: The Heroic True Story of the 1908 New York to Paris Auto Race</em> and <em>The Case of Abraham Lincoln: A Story of Adultery, Murder, and the Making of a Great President</em>.</p>Fr. Michael McGivney (1852&#x2013;1890) is under consideration for sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church. So why has almost no one heard of this Connecticut parish priest who helped to transform American Catholicism? McGivney entered seminary when he was just 16 and studied there until his father's unexpected death forced him, the eldest child, to abandon his studies and support his family. Although the diocese eventually came through with a scholarship, McGivney never forgot the devastation of his family's sudden poverty and devoted much of his priestly life to helping the Catholic poor. He founded the Knights of Columbus, an organization that simultaneously met two critical needs of Catholics in the late 19th century: it was an insurance policy for the indigent, and its devotion to America and patriotic ideals helped to assuage anti-Catholic prejudice. Brinkley and Fenster offer a popular history that is accessible in style and respectful, albeit at times hagiographic, in tone. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gary Allen wen on to study art at the State University of New York College at New Paltz and is now a designer at The Culinary Institute of America In Hyde Park, New York. He lives in High Falls, New York, with his wife and stepson.</p>Grade 4-5 As in other titles in this series, George constructs a story featuring a particular child who spends a day alone in a natural habitat. Rebecca has determined that she will find an ovenbird in Teatown Woods in the Hudson Highlands of New York. The story is a vehicle for introducing the wildlife inhabiting the five layers of plant life in the woodlandsthe canopy, shrub, field, litter, and soil. Rebecca's encounters with various animals are gentle and respectful. One mishap occurs when Rebecca's forgotten magnifying glass catches the sun and starts a small fire; no drama ensues, for this is a sensible child who knows just what to do, supplying a small lesson in outdoor safety. The day climaxes at sunset with the appearance of the ovenbird and a concert of amazingly varied sound. Pleasing pencil drawings depict the animals in varied degrees of realism and follow some of Rebecca's activities. The repeated reference to animals as "wizards of the woods" adds a precious note to the quiet tale, and the slim book with its spacious format has a "young" look which belies the more difficult reading level of the text. This approach to natural history appeals to certain readers, and the volumes offer creative teaching possibilities.

Tom and Hester have settled in safe Anchorage-in-Vineland with their teenage daughter. Wren, however, thinks that Anchorage is a tad too remote and longs to have adventures like her parents. Opportunity presents itself when a mysterious submarine carrying a group of Lost Boys arrives in Vineland and their leader recruits Wren to steal a mysterious Tin Book. She is kidnapped and sold as a slave. While Tom and Hester set out to rescue her, others, including former adversary Anna Fang, resurrected as the evil robot Stalker Fang, also try to get the book. Reeve keeps the multiple plots moving with surprises, tragedy, and multiple betrayals, and while at first the pacing seems a bit off as the action moves from one group to the next, things speed up by the second half of the book. The final showdown that brings the various threads of plot and all the major characters together is breathtaking. The open-ended conclusion more than begs for an immediate sequel.<i>&#x2013;Tim Wadham, Maricopa County Library District, Phoenix, AZ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Outside, a long line snaked by the poolside entrance to the Mutiny Club. If everyone in Miami claimed to know Willy&#x2014;his gig won him side jobs from VIPs and action from a smorgasbord of chicks&#x2014;it was because they wanted inside, where the action was.</p><p>Gomez, you could say, was living the dream.</p><p>Save for tonight.</p><p>As he came down the stairs from the club to the hotel&#x2019;s lobby, he heard a commotion.</p><p>Co�o tu madre!

[Eat lead, faggot!]</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck me,&#x201d; thought Gomez, stifling the urge to piss himself. Ricardo &#x201c;Monkey&#x201d; Morales, a Mutiny regular, was pointing his gun at some other thug. So intense was the vitriol that spit was flying in the air.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew Ricky was a CIA guy&#x2014;an informant,&#x201d; Gomez said of Morales. &#x201c;I knew he was a problem. I knew he was a rat.&#x201d;</p><p>He also knew his&nbsp;.38 Colt revolver was downright Gunsmoke compared with the Monkey&#x2019;s semiautomatic: &#x201c;No way I could let him turn on me with that.&#x201d;</p><p>The domino tables of Little Havana echoed with cigar-smoked tales of el Mono (the Monkey) meting out and cheating death: about how once, in broad daylight, he emptied seventeen rounds from a machine gun into another exile; how there was still shrapnel embedded in the busy Miami street where nine years earlier he had walked away from a car bombing that should have at least severed his legs; how Morales, the lucky bastard, later survived a drive-by shooting that nearly blew out his brains by rolling out of his car and regrouping until he could kill his would-be assassin with gunshots to the face.</p><p>Morales&#x2019;s menacing appearance&#x2014;dead gaze, gorilla-sloped back, huge ears and hands&#x2014;resembled that of some early hominid you might see re-created in the pages of National Geographic.</p><p>Which was seemingly the only publication that hadn&#x2019;t profiled him. Morales had been featured in Esquire, and cover treatments by both Newsday&#x2019;s magazine and Harper&#x2019;s were in the pipeline. The Miami Herald and the Miami News had filing cabinets dedicated to this mythical exile: informant, bomber, drug dealer, assassin, quoter of military histories. Literary agents were calling.</p><p>The Mutiny was where Monkey Morales held court, his bloodstream coursing with cocaine, THC, Quaaludes, Valium, alcohol and caffeine.</p><p>And two decades of Cuban-American rage.</p><p>He always snuck in the back of the hotel and in through the kitchen, where he&#x2019;d hand Chef Manny&#x2014;&#x201c;Manolito!&#x201d;&#x2014;choice little briquettes of cocaine. And maybe a lobster or hog snapper that he had personally speared.</p><p>So, Willy Gomez, security conquistador, hardly ever crossed paths with this guy&#x2014;and he was fine with that. But tonight, for whatever reason, Monkey Morales felt the need to go apeshit a couple of yards from the hotel&#x2019;s front desk.</p><p>&#x201c;Police!&#x201d; yelled Gomez, hand on his gun. &#x201c;Call the police.&#x201d;</p><p>But the lobby had completely emptied out, save for the three of them. Music from the club wafted downstairs:</p><p>I got to ride, ride like the wind</p><p>To be free again</p><p>&#x201c;If I blink,&#x201d; Gomez thought to himself, &#x201c;this psychopath will kill me.&#x201d;</p><p>He resolved to squeeze the trigger. &#x201c;Monkey was already dead, as far as I was concerned. I was worried his brains would splatter on the artwork.&#x201d;</p><p>The future flashed before Gomez. Burton Goldberg, the Mutiny&#x2019;s hard-assed owner, would throw the mother of all shit fits when crime-scene photographers captured the mess in his lobby. He had paid tens of thousands of dollars for Hollywood-caliber set lighting to showcase his art and orchids, micromanaging the scene down to the last lumen. &#x201c;I hired the guy that lit up the Statue of Liberty in &#x2019;seventy-six,&#x201d; Goldberg would always boast to guests.</p><p>Gomez would then have to quit his job, assuming the Mutiny survived the shooting. You didn&#x2019;t just plug Monkey Morales and go on with your life like nothing happened. Yes, many in Miami who hated Morales would send Gomez drinks and introduce the dapper caballero to their daughters and sisters.</p><p>But the Monkey had too many friends in dangerous places&#x2014;spooks, arms dealers, mercenaries, soldiers of fortune&#x2014;who would put a retaliatory hit out on his killer, justified circumstances or not.</p><p>(&#x201c;Or,&#x201d; Willy Gomez thought, &#x201c;if you keep thinking about all this, the Monkey will fucking turn around and kill you himself. Focus!&#x201d;)</p><p>Then the elevator door opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Police!&#x201d; yelled Gomez, with renewed desperation.</p><p>Out walked Rafael Villaverde, Morales&#x2019;s tablemate. As the scene came into focus through his tinted glasses, the paunchy exile grimaced, bit a knuckle and took a hesitating step forward. Willy Gomez now had his gun at Morales&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Villaverde held out his hand. &#x201c;No police!&#x201d; he pleaded, looking at Gomez. &#x201c;Ricky. Ricky. Hey. Look. Mira.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Villaverde then carefully walked up to Morales and whispered something.</p><p>Gomez was still convinced the Monkey would blow him away with a flick of his wrist. He imagined his head in a puddle of blood.</p><p>But Morales rapidly tucked his semiautomatic back into his pants. His rival bolted, but Gomez didn&#x2019;t put away his revolver.</p><p>&#x201c;Get the fuck out of here, Ricky!&#x201d; he yelled to Morales, panting, almost hyperventilating. &#x201c;Try! If you even try to fucking come back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know who you talking to?&#x201d; shot back Morales, snarling. &#x201c;Do. You. Know?&#x201d;</p><p>He pulled back his coat to reveal a giant grenade on his belt. It was practically the size of a Florida avocado.</p><p>The Monkey flashed a deranged grin and took his time walking out the front of the Mutiny.</p><p>Outside, an oblivious and unruly crowd would likely have formed. Giggling groupies checking the shrubs and walkways for the club&#x2019;s gilded matchboxes, looking inside for Quaaludes and nose candy.</p><p>The air would have been pungent with cigarette smoke, preparty rum, various overpowering perfumes, colognes and hairsprays, high-tide salt water, sweaty rayon, joints.</p><p>Desperation.</p><p>Aspiration.</p><p>Ferraris, Porsches, Rollses, Benzes, Maseratis and Lambos pulled up, windows wide-open, blasting Blondie, Donna Summer and &#x201c;Funkytown.&#x201d; The Mutiny&#x2019;s valets were tipped to the cuffs to take their time, hog the curb along South Bayshore Drive and keep the beats pumping.</p><p>Opposite the hotel, a marina led out to a bay containing more than one hundred boats, sails flapping, the occasional manatee scraping up against the bows. Giant yachts ferried area regulars&#x2014;who at times could include names like the Bee Gees and Richard Nixon&#x2014;to land.</p><p>In the shallows, you were bound to find a recently arrived Cuban refugee swatting away mosquitoes with a cigarette, desperate to snag a small shark or ray on a handline. Anything bigger he&#x2019;d hawk a mile north at the big intersection on US-1, where others from the Mariel boatlift emigration of Cubans that spring and summer were selling fruit and hog trotters.</p><p>Abutting this vista were Miami City Hall and the police station.</p><p>Back across South Bayshore Drive&#x2014;&#x201c;Rubberneck Avenue,&#x201d; wags were now calling it&#x2014;a scene of intense star watching was taking place outside the Mutiny. Recently spotted:</p><p>Mr. Universe, Arnold Schwarzenegger, his head appearing freakishly small atop the boulder that was his midsection. The tiny waitress from Michigan he&#x2019;d hit on wondered to a girlfriend how she could possibly mount this beast.</p><p>Paul Newman, small as a jockey, and Sally Field were in town with star director Sydney Pollack to shoot the film Absence of Malice. Newman drank so much of the Mutiny&#x2019;s Ch�teau Lafite that he passed out and literally had to be carried up to his suite by a hostess. A brooding Burt Reynolds kept a watchful eye on Sally.</p><p>Playboy hopefuls visited for casting calls in one of the hotel&#x2019;s 130 fantasy-themed rooms and its Playboy Video set. Penthouse used the joint, too.</p><p>The Eagles had just recorded an album in the studio next door. Waitresses gossiped about which member tipped&#x2014;and bedded&#x2014;the best.</p><p>You&#x2019;d see Frankie Valli, in boosting disco heels&#x2014;not to be confused with Dance Fever host Deney Terrio, who reminded everyone at the Mutiny that, hey, you know, he coached Travolta for Saturday Night Fever.</p><p>And &#x201c;Super Freak&#x201d;&#x2013;destined Rick James, traveling with a delegation of coke whores and a croc-skin man purse full of dainty gold utensils for cutting and sniffing lines. It&#x2019;s true: every other word out of his mouth was &#x201c;bitch.&#x201d; &#x201c;Slick Rick&#x201d; laid into a waitress who accidentally called him &#x201c;miss.&#x201d;</p><p>Ted Kennedy, fresh off conceding the Democratic presidential nomination, had often been deep in his cups at the Mutiny, where he hated bumping into Jimmy Carter wingman Hamilton Jordan, who was constantly in Miami to negotiate asylum in Panama for the deposed shah of Iran. Kennedy picked a fight with the club&#x2019;s DJ, who was helping Julio Iglesias, a Mutiny resident, hype his latest record. You catch all that?</p><p>The Doobie Brothers partied hard at the Mutiny, where the joke was they were into way more than just doobies&#x2014;no: the powdery stuff was what inspired band members and their roadies to mindlessly throw cash down from their windows.</p><p>And always wandering the grounds like a lost dog was David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x2014;his mustache and teeth nasty from constantly smoking freebase cocaine with a small blowtorch.</p><p>For all the intense people watching at 2951 South Bayshore Drive, however, the true players at the Mutiny had nothing to do with Hollywood or Motown or the Beltway.</p><p>They were Miami&#x2019;s ruling drug lords. With bullets flying everywhere there at all hours of the day, the town was increasingly being called Dodge City. And so these guys were its &#x201c;cocaine cowboys,&#x201d; the Latin masterminds of the era&#x2019;s go-go wonder drug: yeyo, perico, toot, snow, white pony. Cocaine. And the Mutiny was their favorite saloon.</p><p>It was in this parallel universe that the Mutiny&#x2019;s free-spending cocaine lords swapped their old-world names (say, Wilfredo Perez del Cayo) for Cubano goodfella handles like Carlene, Redbeard, Coca-Cola, el Loco, the Boys, Recotado (&#x201c;Stocky&#x201d;), Veneno (&#x201c;Venom&#x201d;). Weetchie, Chunky, Peloo, Perro (&#x201c;Dog&#x201d;), Mungy. Venao (&#x201c;Deer&#x201d;), Raspao (&#x201c;Snow Cone&#x201d;), the Big Blonde, Super Papi. Chino, Albertico, Kiki.</p><p>Even their pets lived extra large.</p><p>Kingpin Mario Tabraue had a chimp named Caesar, whom he adorned with a gold-rope necklace holding a fifty-peso gold coin, an eighteen-karat ID bracelet with his name in diamonds and a ladies&#x2019; Rolex Presidential. The primate was partial to turtlenecks and a New York baseball cap, and proudly rode shotgun in his owner&#x2019;s Benz while waving a Cuban cigar.</p><p>They&#x2019;d shuttle to and from Tabraue&#x2019;s mansion around the corner, where panthers, pythons, raptors and even a toucan roamed the grounds. Tabraue fed live rats to a two-headed snake and an owl he kept in a Plexiglas cage. He would sometimes answer the door with a tarantula peeking out from under his cap.</p><p>&#x201c;Every known narcotic trafficker in Miami would be at the Mutiny,&#x201d; recalled Diosdado &#x201c;D. C.&#x201d; Diaz, a Miami police detective. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d see their wives and mistresses there. Their hit men. They&#x2019;d throw a big celebration every time they brought in a load; they&#x2019;d send Cristal and Dom to dealers at other tables. I&#x2019;d follow the bottles and jot down their license plate numbers.&#x201d;</p><p>So vital was the Mutiny for watching the interplay of dealers, informants, celebs and public figures, he says, that authorities were understandably loath to disturb the ecosystem. &#x201c;Why stir up the pot and scare them all away?&#x201d; Diaz said.</p><p>Indeed, just as Monkey Morales was about to get his brains blown out by the bouncer in the lobby, his tablemate, one of Miami&#x2019;s biggest cocaine dealers, attempted to bribe D. C. Diaz with a Rolex and an antique, World War II&#x2013;issue gun. However, the kingpin refused to part ways with a silencer-equipped MAC-10 submachine gun that Monkey had lent him and wanted back.</p><p>On the very week Morales stared down Gomez, owner Burton Goldberg threw a raucous Halloween bash at the club.</p><p>Yes, you could argue Miami was now devolving into a third-world republic that was bound to break off and sink into the Atlantic. But the Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, adorned with lush, carefully lit foliage and stunning women, was raking it in.</p><p>And so the woolly-chested Goldberg donned two-inch eyelashes, a flowing blond wig and a long white gown, and skipped around tapping guests with his wand&#x2014;a fairy godmother pretending to sprinkle magic pixie dust.</p><p>Subtle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1</p><p>Heaven in Hell</p><p>Burton Goldberg&#x2019;s Mutiny at Sailboat Bay was one of the country&#x2019;s most lucrative hotels, perennially overbooked and sending off armored trucks with sacks of its cash profits, albeit in the new murder and drug capital of America, a city that had been ravaged by race riots, gun killings and the sudden arrival of 125 thousand Cuban refugees, many of them sprung right from Fidel Castro&#x2019;s jails.</p><p>By the turn of the decade, the 130-room hotel and club was a criminal free-trade zone of sorts where gangsters could both revel in Miami&#x2019;s danger and escape from it.</p><p>&#x201c;All roads led back to the Mutiny,&#x201d; said Wayne Black, an undercover cop who listened in to dope deals from a tinted van across the street, often wearing nothing but BVDs to cope with the stifling heat and humidity. &#x201c;The druggies,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the celebs, the crooked pols, spies, the informants, cops&#x2014;good and bad&#x2014;were all there.&#x201d;</p><p>America in the late 1970s and early &#x2019;eighties was in a pronounced funk: inflation and unemployment were high; consumer sentiment was in the dumps. But so exceptional was Miami&#x2019;s cocaine economy that dopers were paying banks to accept suitcases full of cash (while certificates of deposit were yielding 20 percent, on top of your choice of toaster or alarm clock). According to one study from Florida International University in Miami, at least one-third of the city&#x2019;s economic output was derived from narcotics at the time.</p><p>So much hot money was sloshing around Miami that the Mutiny was selling more bottles of Dom Perignon than any other establishment on the planet, according to the bubbly&#x2019;s distributor, whose executives visited in disbelief at the turn of the decade. They heard right: a suite at the hotel was converted into a giant walk-in cooler; beautiful women would ooh and ahh at tabletop cascades of bubbly in stacks of flutes; dopers bought bottles for the house when their loads came in and management often flew out the Mutiny&#x2019;s private plane at the last minute to procure even more from other cities.</p><p>Internationally wanted hit men and mercenaries chilled at the Mutiny. Frequent visitors kept their guns tucked in the cushions, and cases of cash and cocaine in their suites. Bullets flew. Thugs were nabbed. Refugees snuck in. Cops were bribed. Dopers were recorded. Pilots were hired. Contracts were placed.

To this end, they have divided their study into three fields of inquiry:<br> <br><b>Genetics and the ET Hypothesis</b>: Was life on Earth actually initiated by alien life forms deliberately? Many cultures worldwide hold clues in their mythos that points to this. But for what ultimate purpose would this have? And what does that make humanity?<br> <br><b>Consciousness</b>: If the building blocks of life were truly transplanted by a higher intelligence with intent, was our human concept of consciousness included in that DNA? And as we evolve, are we headed toward eventual immortality as sentient beings?<br> <br><b>Human-Machine Symbiosis</b>: In this section, the concept of technological advancement is explored&#x2014;focusing on our own astounding achievements in recent years in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and robotics&#x2014;which leads to a much deeper question: If we have come so far so fast, what unfathomable level of technology must the phenomenon already possess?<br> <br>In <i>Sekret Machines: Man</i>, DeLonge and Levenda go beyond the lies fed to the public for decades&#x2014;using unsealed confidential records, expert analysis, and eyewitness testimony from scientists, civilians, military personnel, researchers, and UFO experiencers to reveal the wide-ranging influence that UFO forces have had upon our past, continue to exert on our present, and may hold for our future.<br> <br>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom DeLonge is an award-winning producer, author, platinum recording artist, researcher and entrepreneur from San Diego, CA. Today Tom, with his company To The Stars, produces original content that aims to inspire a newfound appreciation of the profound, yet unresolved, mysteries involving science and the universe through entertainment directly informed by science. His first multi-media franchise Love, told the story of an isolated astronaut on the International Space Station and included a double album by his band Angels And Airwaves with the feature film premiering in 600 theatres across the United States. His next franchise Poet Anderson was inspired by a dream study conducted at Stanford University and spanned an award-winning short film, a chart-topping album, acclaimed comic book series, graphic novel and a YA science fiction novel co-written with NYTimes Bestselling author Suzanne Young. Most recently he is working on Sekret Machines which spans both sci-fi fiction and nonfiction thesis informed by unprecedented access at the highest level of the government and science to uncover information about the UFO phenomenon with renowned authors AJ Hartley and Peter Levenda. His Sekret Machines work has won him the 2017 UFO Researcher of the Year award.<br><br>Peter Levenda is a native of the Bronx, New York but has lived or traveled all over the United States and the world in the course of his life, work and research. As an executive with an American telecommunications manufacturer he was based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for more than seven years. Before that he was one of the first Americans to do business (successfully) in China. He has an MA in Religious Studies and Asian Studies from FIU, and speaks a variety of languages (some of them dead). He was briefly detained at the notorious Nazi sanctuary and interrogation center Colonia Dignidad in Chile, in 1979 during the course of research for Unholy Alliance. He has appeared in numerous television programs for the History Channel, the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, and TNT as an expert on Nazi Germany and especially on the extreme religious and esoteric ideas that formed the Nazi worldview. He has interviewed Nazis, neo-Nazis, Klansmen, occultists, CIA officers, and Islamic terrorists in the course of his research and has visited Chinese prisons and military bases; Buddhist temples; Muslim boarding schools in Indonesia; Russian Orthodox monasteries; mosques in Europe, the United States and Asia; the Palestine Liberation Organization; several voodoo hounforts; the former KGB headquarters (Dzherzinsky Square) in Moscow; has been held at gunpoint in Latin America, and celebrated with a state dinner in Beijing. At the age of seventeen he gate-crashed the funeral for assassinated Senator Robert F. Kennedy at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, and led the procession out of the cathedral. (He graduated high school later that month.) He was a member of the same front organization -- a renegade Ukrainian church in the Bronx -- that provided cover for David Ferrie and Jack Martin (suspected co-conspirators in the JFK assassination). In addition, he was an auxiliary police officer for the New York Police Department. His published work has been praised by Norman Mailer, Jim Hougan, Dick Russell, Whitley Strieber, Katherine Neville, and many others. He is or was a member of MENSA, of the American Academy of Religion, of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, of the Norman Mailer Society, and the T. E.

Special Agent Sam Jameson is having a bad week. People are trying to kill her.

As the noose tightens around her neck, Sam must uncover a brutal and deadly conspiracy before she becomes its next victim. THE INCIDENT: Inferno Rising is the first installment in the runaway international sensation INCIDENT trilogy from conspiracy master Lars Emmerich. &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Interview with #1 Bestselling Author Lars Emmerich Q: Who are your influences? A: Too many to list! I started out years ago as a Tom Clancy addict, and I thoroughly enjoy many of Nelson DeMille&#x2019;s novels. I regularly read David Baldacci, Vince Flynn, Barry Eisler, Michael Connelly, and John Grisham. James Patterson has redefined what it means to be a working author, and I read his stuff as well. My top picks are usually espionage and private detective novels, any of the thousands of thrillers and mysteries best sellers, and, of course, books featuring classic pulp heroes. And I&#x2019;m greatly influenced by all sorts of nonfiction, as well. I read all the time, and I&#x2019;m a bit of a magpie about the topics &#x2014; science, economics, finance, politics, history, mathematics, engineering, biomechanics, medicine... It&#x2019;s a big world out there, and I love learning more about it. Many of those topics find their way into my fiction, so I can justify it all as &#x201c;research.&#x201d; Q: The Sam Jameson series has become quite a phenomenon. What do you think has been the driving force behind the books&#x2019; success? A: I think Sam has something of a unique voice. She says the things we all wish we could say, and she gets away with it about half of the time. The other half of the time, not so much. I think she&#x2019;s also a very human heroine. She has plenty of flaws and weaknesses, yet she accomplishes some amazing things. She&#x2019;s kind of like every one of us in that regard, which resonates. Q: You have developed personal relationships with your readers over the years, which is unusual in the publishing business. Was that a conscious choice? A: Absolutely. Books are intimate things. They occupy a person&#x2019;s mind and thoughts for hours at a time. Good books leave a lasting impression, and great books might even change the way we think about things, but all books are a relationship. I felt that Big Publishing did a great job of distributing novels, but at a very high cost &#x2014; there was almost no way for a personal connection to form between writers and readers. But I always wanted a conversation. I wanted to learn from my readers, to hear what was on their minds, to listen to their criticism and hopefully improve the books I write. It&#x2019;s been extremely rewarding, and I&#x2019;m hopeful it can continue for years to come.</p><p></p><h2>My Trading Bible</h2><p>"READS LIKE A CLASSIC" Market Wizard, Mark Minervini "THE BEST BOOK THAT WILL NEVER GET AN AWARD" William Leung, Trader, China The market wizards have given the widest variety of trading advice imaginable. Ritchie continues the trend with a ground breaking thesis that one must learn how to lose. Everyone wants to take on risk, reap the rewards, and do it without any drawdown. Ritchie provides the first mathematical proof that such a goal is impossible, and could be a recipe for disaster. Ritchie gives you two choices &#x2013; lose like a pro and keep trading, or lose like a novice and quit. He even includes sections for Christians who quietly suffer from the guilt of expanding the gap between the rich and everyone else.</p><p>Mark Andrew Ritchie grew up in the deep south, an Oregon coast logging town, and Afghanistan, where he traded for pigeons, kites, and glass string. He was one of four founding partners of CRT, a participant in Jack Schwager&#x2019;s bestselling, "New Market Wizards", and creator of the RR trading app. After raising 5 kids with his wife, she engaged him to follow her dream--working with orphans in Asia where he became immersed in barefoot banking.

Together they oversee Mark Hanby Ministries/Fathers Heart Ministries, an internationally recognized teaching and resource center.Grade 3-6&#x2013;Yolen and her daughter outline the basic events that gripped this community while boxed text, drawn to look like pages from an investigator's notebook, add context. Smaller sidebars define some of the terms used. The book concludes with a presentation of some of the extant theories of what caused the girls' hysteria and the reactions of the other townspeople, with questions for readers, based on the text, that may support or attack each theory. Roth's graphite-and-watercolor illustrations, done in somber tones, convey the bleakness of the Colonial winter and the drama of the unfolding events. There have been a number of books for this audience covering the Salem witch trials, Edward Dolan's (Benchmark, 2001), Tamra Orr's (Blackbirch, 2004), and Stephen Currie's (KidHaven, 2002), among them. While these titles cover the facts more completely and may be better suited for reports, the investigative approach used here gives a different perspective and encourages readers to evaluate the evidence and draw their own conclusions.<i>&#x2013;Elaine Fort Weischedel, Millbury Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Both science and the Bible show us that the most important thing we can provide for our kids is a place of emotional safety. In other words, the <i>posture </i>from which we parent matters infinitely more than the techniques of parenting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Emotional safety&#x2014;more than any other factor&#x2014;is scientifically linked to raising kids who live, love, and lead well. Learn how to use emotional safety as a foundation from which you parent&#x2014;and make a cultural impact that could change the world!<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Safe House, </i>Dr. Straub draws from his extensive research and personal experience to help you:<br> &nbsp;<br>- Foster healthy identity and social development in children of any age <br>- Win the war without getting overwhelmed in the daily battles <br>- Discipline in a way that builds relationship <br>- Understand how the culture is affecting your child and what you can do about it <br>- Cultivate responsible, self-regulating behavior in your kids<br>- Establish an unshakeable sense of faith, morality, and values in your home<br>- Feel more confident and peaceful as a parent<br>- Find a greater perspective on parenting than what you might see on a daily basis <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Also includes a Safe House Parenting Assessment.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Joshua Straub, Ph.D., is an author, speaker, and family advocate.

There&#x2019;s also no greater sorrow than when you don&#x2019;t feel like you have what it takes to do it. Using the transparency of his own story, as well as his experience as a family counselor and dad himself, Josh provides a road map for making our homes the emotionally safest places in the world for our kids.

As a product of six broken homes and a lot of abuse, I know the urgency and the desperation to rewrite my story for my children&#x2019;s sake, and for heaven&#x2019;s sake. Many of us are familiar with panicked efforts to child-proof our homes, but after decades of training students, I often wondered if it was possible to parent-proof our children.

It will include both practical instruction and examples that explain the skills needed to work as a professional script supervisor. It will also contain stories from my many years on extraordinary film sets that will bring those examples to life. </p> <p>The author&nbsp;will walk the reader through the process of becoming and working as a script supervisor. Included will be the basic skills such as how to breakdown a script, taking notes on set, matching, cheating, screen direction, and what the director, actors and editor expect from a script supervisor. The book will also include many of the more subtle but just as important skills, how to get a job, how to tell what is important in a script and on set, how to get along with the cast and crew, and how not to get overwhelmed when there is too much information to process.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our basic job as script supervisors is to understand and record the most essential elements of the film. In the past, we were often looked upon as secretaries. Things have changed and now we are usually thought of more like executive assistants, true filmmakers, a director's backup and secret weapon. This change has come at the same time and in connection with a new film language. Post-modernist filmmaking is changing the grammar of the film and of course rules that we script supervisors used to champion. When it is no longer forbidden to cross the 180 line, our job is now to know what it means to cross the 180 line. Or to mix frame sizes, jump time or any of the poetic leaps that many of our contemporary filmmakers are now taking. </p> <p>There hasn't been a 'how-to' book about script supervising since this change has happened. This will be the first to address and explore the dynamics of this new filmmaking.</p> <br><br>awesome key features here</p><p>Mary Cybulski is a script supervisor with more than twenty years experience.

This collective memory works through morphic fields, which organize the bodies of plants and animals, coordinate the activities of brains, and underlie conscious mental activity. Sheldrake shows how all human beings draw upon and contribute to a collective human memory and that even our individual recollections depend on morphic resonance rather than physical storage in the brain. He explores the major role that morphic resonance plays not just in animal instincts and cultural inheritance, such as religion and ritual, but also in the larger process of evolution, which Sheldrake shows to be more an interplay of habit and creativity than a mere &#x201c;survival of the fittest.&#x201d; <br> <br>Offering a replacement for the outdated, mechanistic worldview that has dominated biology since the nineteenth century, Sheldrake&#x2019;s new understanding of life, matter, and mind shows that rather than being ruled by fixed laws, nature is essentially habitual.

At first glance the question seems ridiculous, because the apparent scarcity of time is a constant source of stress in our busy lives. There are not enough hours in the day, we say as we collapse late at night. Deep down we know that we cannot go on like this.</p><p>Father Stinnisen's book dares us to see time with new eyes. The insight that eternity is written in the depths of our hearts helps us to live in time in a way that leads us deeper into God's joy. We are like children in a land of fairy tales where everything is exciting and exploration never ends.We therefore should rejoice that everything around us is great and mysterious and that we can live in eternal wonder.</p><p>His intention is not to explain what time is and thus take away its mystery. Instead, his aim is to show us how to see time from different perspectives and to discover how rich and multifaceted it is. Above all, he demonstrates how we can make use of the tremendous possibilities that time offers to us.</p></p><p><p><b>Fr. Wilfrid Stinissen, O.C.D.</b>,&nbsp;was born in Antwerp, Belgium, where he entered the Carmelite Order in 1944. He was sent to Sweden in 1967 to co-found a small contemplative community. His many books on the spiritual life have been translated into multiple languages. Among his works available in English are&nbsp;<i>Into Your Hands, Father</i> and <i>The Holy Spirit, Fire of Divine Love.</i></p><p>"Father Stinissen's writing is profound enough for theologians, yet accessible enough for anyone seeking a fuller and more meaningful spiritual life." --<br><strong>Vinny Flynn</strong>, Author, <em>7 Secrets of the Eucharist</em></p><br><br><p>"The important truths taught here by Father Stinissen are well served by the simple beauty with which he explains them. Time is much more complex than the way we perceive&nbsp;it from our limited perspective. The ultimate understanding must be revealed by Christ, who entered chronology from eternity and graciously gave us clues." --<br><strong>Fr. George Rutler</strong>, Author, <em>Calm in Chaos: Catholic Wisdom for Anxious Times</em></p><br><br><p>"Father Stinissen's many references to Scripture on the subject of time, his wide-ranging use of saintly and secular thought, and his love for Saint Augustine's engagement with the perplexity of passing time, make this book a wonderful spiritual experience. We find ourselves provoked to remember the true shortness of life, while glancing often toward the blessedness of eternity, as we turn the pages of this very fine book." --<br><strong>Fr.

His serigraphs were large expanses of rich color, which gave the viewer a very different perspective on the animal kingdom. A conservationist as well as an artist, Harper revealed the unique aspects of his wildlife subjects through highly stylized geometric reduction. Harper said he was "the only wildlife artist who has never been compared to Audubon," yet his wildlife art was just as instructive - the only difference was that Harper laced his lessons with humor. Harper believed that humor made it easier to encourage changes in our attitudes and awareness of environmental concerns.Little children are going to love exploring the unique artwork and delightful rhyming text in this special book. --Through the Looking Glass Children&#39;s Book Reviews</p><h2>A Soup Opera</h2><p>A Soup Opera is a richly illustrated story about a man, a bowl of soup, and the man&#39;s comically frustrating quest to eat that soup.

Contrary to what some may think, structure is not a nasty inhibitor of creativity. Quite the opposite. Properly understood and utilized, structure is what translates story into a form readers are wired to receive it.</p><p>And it is only when readers truly connect with your story that they turn from casual readers into fans.</p><p>The material in this book greatly expands upon the chapter on structure in Write Your Novel From the Middle. Super Structure can be considered a companion to that book, but it also stands alone in its treatment of the elements of a solid and pleasing plot.</p><p>Here's more good news: Super Structure will work for any type of writer--those who like to outline, those who just fly by "the seat of the pants," and those who do a little of both. That's because Super Structure stresses the concept of "signpost scenes." There are fourteen signpost scenes, or beats, that can be used to create an entire plot, the skeleton of an idea, or a map to help you figure out what to write next.</p><p>Every signpost is given its own chapter and explanation, along with a section called "Helpful Hints for Plotters and Pantsers," showing you how to apply what you've learned and adapt it to your own style of writing.</p><p>Never write a weak novel or screenplay again. Super Structure is a proven foundation that never fails. It frees you to add your original voice and vision, all of which adds up to bestselling fiction and hit screenplays.</p><p>"I need three things before I tackle a new novel: Diet Coke, a laptop, and my dog-eared copies of James Scott Bell's books on writing craft!&#x201d; - <b>Kami Garcia</b>, #1 NY Times &amp; International Bestselling author</p></p><p>James Scott Bell is the author of the "Write Great Fiction: Plot &amp; Structure", a top-selling WDB title, as well as the recently released "Write Great Fiction: Revision &amp; Self-Editing".

However, for those who revere Rand&#x2019;s work and subscribe to her particular philosophy of objectivism this novel could be set in the present day instead of some unidentified future in which mankind has entered a dark age characterized by irrationality, collectivism, and socialistic thinking. In this dystopian novella we find a world where technological advancement is now carefully planned and the concept of individuality has been eliminated. The central characters of the story are Equality 7-2521, a free thinking inventor, and his love interest, Liberty 5-3000. Like most dystopian works, &#x201c;Anthem&#x201d; describes a strange and unfathomable world which could never exist. It is in the creation of this extreme world that Rand creates a parable to warn us against what she believed were the perils of socialism. What is clearly a response to the oppressiveness of the Soviet Union, &#x201c;Anthem&#x201d; continues to resonate with those fearful of collectivist political philosophy gone too far.

He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: he had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone.<p>Ayn Rand's classic tale of a future dark age of the great "We" -- in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values -- anticipates her later masterpieces, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.</p><p><strong>Ayn Rand </strong>(1905-1982)<strong> </strong>was born in Russia, graduated from the University of Leningrad, and came to the United States in 1926.

How would I do it? Pick them clean up off their foundations? Dismantle them brick by brick and rebuild them miles away? Move in when the owners went on vacation and barricade myself inside? It didn&#x2019;t make sense. But after that day&#x2019;s meeting with the police officers at my middle school&#x2019;s office, Mom imagined my sad trajectory: a referral one day, a suspension the next, and before you know it . . . stealing houses.</p><p>I made my first walk to the principal&#x2019;s office in kindergarten back when I was Jorge Watsky&#x2014;just the first of many boneheaded, bizarre, and entirely avoidable delinquencies. Buena Vista elementary, in San Francisco&#x2019;s Potrero Hill District, was a language immersion school, meaning every class was taught in Spanish from the moment Mom and Dad dropped us off on the curb to the moment they picked us up. Classes were small and teachers truly cared about the kids. The only way to make yourself invisible was to speak English.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been sitting cross-legged on the floor for story time one day, my grasp of the language&#x2014;only a few months into kindergarten&#x2014; delicate, my attention drifting. Catarina was, like many other Buena Vista teachers, an optimistic, young (but at the time, to me, very old) woman, the tendrils of her unshaved armpits creeping out from her colorful Mexican sundress. The dress fascinated me&#x2014;the darkness underneath, so vast and mysterious. Everything was big- ger then. And after Catarina banished me from class, the hallway swallowed me too, endlessly quiet except for the echo of my foot- steps and my pounding heart. The principal reasonably wanted to know what possessed me to crawl under my teacher&#x2019;s skirt.</p><p><i>&#x201c;�Por qu�, Jorge? �Por qu�?&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Because I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jorge, no,&#x201d; the principal cut me off.&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;En espa�ol.&#x201d; </i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Quer�a ver lo que hay ah� abajo.&#x201d;</i></p><p>It was simple:&nbsp;<i>I wanted to see what&#x2019;s under there.</i></p><p>Over Christmas break in second grade, my parents sat my brother and me down at the same dining room table at which I would contemplate house-stealing six years later, many of its battle scars yet to appear. Just from the stiff silence in the room, the way they&#x2019;d staged us across from them, I felt an ominous rot in the pit of my stomach. Secrets hung in the air, consequences waiting to descend on us. I knew this emotion well: the feeling of being called to the principal&#x2019;s office.</p><p>We hadn&#x2019;t done anything wrong, they told us. On the contrary, this was fabulous news. They&#x2019;d found a great new school for us, Alamo, much closer to our Richmond District house.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t thought of it as anything more than a funny story when I&#x2019;d told my parents about Buena Vista&#x2019;s recess playground drills&#x2014;how one whistle meant we were lining up to go back inside, two whistles meant earthquake drill, and three whistles meant to lie flat on your belly on the schoolyard asphalt, separated from the public park on Potrero by a chain-link fence. No kid ever got hit by a stray bullet, but once in a while our teacher&#x2019;s back</p><p>would stiffen when we heard a loud&nbsp;<i>pop!&nbsp;</i>coming from the park.</p><p><i>You&#x2019; ll love Alamo!&nbsp;</i>they insisted.&nbsp;<i>How could you not, with a school motto like &#x201c;Be a Friend!&#x201d; and a mascot like the goofy, grinning Alamo Alligator? Plus, Alamo is a feeder school for Estacada&#x2014;the top public middle school in the city&#x2014;and, best of all, everything&#x2019;s already been arranged. You start as soon as Christmas break is over!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Cantonese, &#x201c;Happy New Year!&#x201d; is&nbsp;<i>Gung Hay Fat Choy</i>, &#x201c;fart&#x201d; is&nbsp;<i>fong pei</i>, and &#x201c;flower bridge&#x201d; is&nbsp;<i>fa kieu</i>&#x2014;a classic excuse to get away with saying &#x201c;fuck you&#x201d; on the playground. That&#x2019;s all I remember from my Chinese language&#x2013;learning program, the only class at Alamo with room to take my brother and me midway through second grade. Twice a week we&#x2019;d study Cantonese and take calligraphy classes, but none of it stuck. Buena Vista had been all over the map ethnically&#x2014; Mission District Latino kids, black kids, white kids in tie-dye shirts with hippy parents. Maybe it was because we all started out together, or maybe we were just too young to appreciate our differences at Buena Vista. I was an alien at Alamo.</p><p>I had a brand-new nickname to replace Jorge&#x2014;&#x201c;white boy.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t meant as a compliment. Alamo was so packed with carpet- baggers like me spilling out the windows that they built temporary classroom bungalows on the yard, where I took third grade. Alamo&#x2019;s strengths fueled its budget woes in an ironic cycle: The school was strapped for cash because it was crowded, it was crowded because it was desirable, it was desirable because it was high performing, and, because it was high performing, it was further strapped for cash. Public schools in San Francisco are funded in a need-based system&#x2014;the schools with the best standardized test scores get the least money. The schools that did the best were heavily Asian, and Alamo, boasting more than a dozen third graders with the last name Wong, was no exception. Kids ate Spam musubi and dry ramen for lunch, sprinkling the powder packets over the noodles and crunch- ing the uncooked chunks like crackers. Monday talk centered around weekend sermons at the local Chinese Presbyterian church. And on Lunar New Year, when we exchanged&nbsp;<i>Gung Hey Fat Choy</i>s</p><p>and kids stacked heavy piles of red and gold envelopes from their grandparents, uncles, and aunts, comparing their little skyscrapers of cash at lunchtime, I stewed in my envy.</p><p>Soon after arriving, my brother and I got more good news from our parents&#x2014;we were getting braces. To be fair, braces aren&#x2019;t a scarlet letter in elementary school. Everyone&#x2019;s got &#x2019;em, everyone brags about the&nbsp;<i>tight&nbsp;</i>new holiday-themed color scheme of their bands&#x2014;orange and black (Halloween), green (St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day, duh)&#x2014;and everyone brags again about how smooth their teeth feel when they come off. But I didn&#x2019;t get standard braces. I got neck gear, a medieval steel rack that curves around the outside of a nerd&#x2019;s overbite and locks into bands around the back molars, ratcheted by a strap that soaks up neck sweat until the padding smells like spoiled cheese. For a few months, through a conspiracy between my parents and orthodontist, I even had to wear the contraption to school. My vintage look included my neck gear, my favorite black snapback hat with its severely bent red brim, and my turtleneck collar, pulled high.</p><p>Insecurity takes many forms. It can make a person shrink or put them on the attack; I got loud. I tried to neutralize the barbs by aiming them at myself, anxious that if I didn&#x2019;t cram myself into every silence, someone else might fill it with an insult. I had a seemingly unlimited wealth of annoying insights, and as elementary school dragged on, I was powerless to stop them from escaping the dungeon of my mouth, its orthodontic shackles and oppressive Lunchables breath.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, it&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>octopi</i>, not&nbsp;<i>octopuses</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Third grade was spent propping my arm up at the elbow until Mrs. Luchesi reluctantly called on me. In fourth grade Mr. Gomez was so exasperated he moved my desk into the hallway. In fifth grade I protested Mrs. Avery&#x2019;s rule that only girls could wear hats in class, &#x201c;in case they have a bad hair day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Boys have bad hair days too!&#x201d; I insisted. &#x201c;Look!&#x201d;</p><p>Constant hat-wearing and infrequent showering had given me disgusting dandruff, and Mrs. Avery and I found a good rhythm: I&#x2019;d remove my favorite cap briefly to show her my greasy, matted- down mop, claw at my itchy scalp, send a thick flurry of flakes to my desk, pull my hat back on, she&#x2019;d demand I remove it, I&#x2019;d give her some lip, and she&#x2019;d send me down to Darcy&#x2019;s office.</p><p>I remember the view from my seat in front of Principal Darcy Bustamante&#x2019;s desk vividly: the window to the playground over her right shoulder, where light streamed in on sunny days, Ms. Bustamante&#x2019;s hair coiffed in a high blond beehive, her brow furrowed in deep concern, warning me of the slippery slope of misbehavior as I nodded along, daydreaming, studying the framed poster over her left shoulder of a big red apple, popping against a white background, captioned everything i need to know i learned in kindergarten.</p><p><i>Yeah, right,&nbsp;</i>I thought.&nbsp;<i>Sell it to Jorge.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Alamo&#x2019;s, the principal&#x2019;s office at Estacada Middle School was not designed to make convicts comfortable. There were no scenic views, no cute inspirational posters. Cloudy glass windows latticed with wire honeycomb allowed a trickle of light to complement the unreliable overheard fluorescents. Every object and surface, with the exception of the gray polystyrene ceiling tiles, linoleum flooring, and Principal Lim himself&#x2014;a slight Chinese man with a thin pencil mustache&#x2014;was made of the same heavy walnut original to the 1929 building: the door, the room&#x2019;s trim, the chairs, and the massive desk, covered in little nicks and scratches, varnished and revarnished. The principal&#x2019;s desk reminded me of my dining room table, how I could read its history by running my hand over its wounds, imagining nail marks of kids in the thirties clawing at the desk during canings.</p><p>Urban public schools don&#x2019;t run on sympathy. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a coincidence that Alamo was named after&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>Alamo&#x2014;the famous Texas fortress&#x2014;and&nbsp;<i>estacada&nbsp;</i>means &#x201c;stockade&#x201d; in Spanish. Or that the crop of San Francisco&#x2019;s district middle schools that sprouted in the1920s share suspiciously similar Spanish colonial revival architecture with the maximum-security San Quentin State Prison across the bay. For most of middle school I got straight As, with the exception of gym class, but I viewed teachers suspiciously. Estacada&#x2019;s a good school as city schools go, but with five hundred kids in each overcrowded grade, and a staff of underpaid, overworked teachers, the system functions through discipline, Ritalin, and respect for authority&#x2014;anything to keep the school from descending into anarchy.</p><p>But I always had to know why:&nbsp;<i>Why&nbsp;</i>can&#x2019;t we be on the yard during a free period?&nbsp;<i>Why&nbsp;</i>can&#x2019;t I chew gum?&nbsp;<i>Why&nbsp;</i>do I have to sing the national anthem?&nbsp;<i>Why&nbsp;</i>can&#x2019;t I end a sentence with a preposition&#x2014; what&#x2019;s that all about? I never got satisfying answers. But whenever the gray intercom wall phone rang in one of my classes, I knew where I was headed.</p><p>By middle school, my neck gear, dandruff, and turtleneck were gone, but I tried on whatever version of myself I thought would help me fit in: I played percussion in the orchestra. I rode the bench on the baseball team. I showed up to chess club practice once&#x2014;the day the yearbook picture was being taken. And I ran for the least competitive student government position available&#x2014;sixth-grade treasurer&#x2014;landing on a student council consisting of myself and sixteen Asian girls.</p><p>I experimented with weird varieties of jeans&#x2014;stone-washed and whiskered one month, baggy the next. I bought a pair of huge floppy raver pants at A�ropostale, puffed my navy blue And 1s (puffing is when you pull the laces out of your shoe, roll up a pair of socks and stick them under the tongue to make your feet look like an anime character&#x2019;s), meticulously planned my first-day-of-school outfit (in seventh grade it was all-red nylon pants and a red Old Navy Tech Vest), and tried spiking my hair, the popular look at the time. Straight black Asian hair is perfect for spiking: You just add a layer of gel to the comb, run it through your hair backward, and boom&#x2014;perfect hedgehog spikes. But Jewy hair doesn&#x2019;t work that way, and more gel just gave me a slimy perm.</p><p>Then, in spring of seventh grade came the FUBU debacle. One weekend I took the 5-Fulton bus to a shop on Market Street that sold gaudy, supposedly trendy, extra-baggy Girbaud jeans with red stripes under the knees and functionless diagonal zippers, plus the latest lines from Rhino, Phat Farm, and, of course, FUBU. I knew instantly when I saw it hanging on the rack&#x2014;the Golden Fleece that would elevate me to high society&#x2014;a huge baby blue baseball jersey that hung halfway to my knees, fubu in white cursive across the chest.</p><p>I wore the jersey only once before I permanently retired it to my closet, laughed out of homeroom the second I stepped through the door.</p><p><i>Don&#x2019;t you know what FUBU stands for?&nbsp;</i>my classmates marveled.</p><p><i>For Us By Us.</i></p><p>Cheeks burning, I brought the jersey straight to my locker in passing period and wore my undershirt the rest of the day.It&#x2019;s not totally fair to say I had no friends. There were kids who let me eat lunch with them, who I cracked jokes with in the halls. Bryan Wong, Jeffrey Chu, Oliver Li, and Will Hsiang put up with me as a Kramer who dropped by their bench every once in a while, but they looked down at the floor when I asked if I could go to CUPC, their church summer camp, or if I could try out for Taisho, the Asian youth basketball team they played on. I didn&#x2019;t have real friends&#x2014;the type you hang out with after school, or talk to about your problems. The type who want to be around you as much as you want to be around them.</p><p>But no matter what, I always had Thursday to look forward to. Thursday was Nacho Day, my weekly deliverance from rectangular pizzas so oily they&#x2019;d cling suctioned to their plastic containers when held upside down. I survived Estacada on a diet of Fritos, Sprite, and anticipation&#x2014;the faith that Thursday would come again, when the home ec class would set up in the courtyard a period early and heat the cheese vat, and for two fifty I could buy a tray of yellow corn chips drowning in queso, homemade chili, and sliced jalape�os.</p><p>Jalepe�os were first come, first served, and they went fast. Maybe it&#x2019;s a stubbornness I inherited from my dad&#x2014;the way he insists that a Papaya King hot dog is incomplete without sauerkraut&#x2014;but I&#x2019;ve always felt passionately that nachos are naked without jalape�os, and I devoted elaborate efforts to getting in line before they ran out. I might fake sick early on in class, dip out for a bathroom break before the bell, and race to the courtyard. Or maybe I&#x2019;d skip the period before lunch entirely and accept an absence. Every minute counted with kids queuing up fifteen minutes before the bell, and realistically I had to be no more than sixth in line to get peppers. That&#x2019;s not because public school jalape�os come eighteen to a jar&#x2014; it&#x2019;s because of backcutting.</p><p>Backcutting is one of the most shameful practices known to man. Unlike standard cutting,&nbsp;<i>back</i>cutting requires an accomplice in line who allows the cutter to nip in&nbsp;<i>behind&nbsp;</i>them. There&#x2019;s a special place in hell for backcut accomplices&#x2014;gutless suck-ups who shoulder none of the misery they pass on to the chumps after them.

About fifty years too late, butbetter late than never. A diary. I know it's not January 1st, or even November1st, but there is no time like the present. Don't we always say to ourselves:'If only I'd written a diary when I was twenty? Or thirty? Or forty? But in mysixtieth year (or fifty-ninth, to be precise &#x2013; or, oh God, maybe it ismy sixtiethyear &#x2013; I remember some tedious man explaining to me recently how eventhough I'm fifty-nine, I'm actually in my sixtieth year, totallyincomprehensible, but I finally gave in), anyway, in whatever year it is, I,Marie Sharp, retired art teacher, divorced, one son, one cat and resolutelysingle after about one million failed relationships, am determined to give it afinal crack. A diary, that is. Not a relationship.</p><p>Oh dear me no.</p><p>I wrote my first diary when I was ten. Riveting stuff. 'Got up. Went to school.Had maths &#x2013; ugh! Came home. Did prep. Had supper. Went to bed.' I startedanother when I was a teenager, but that was when I had a crush on Archie, whowas a year older than me and had no idea of my feelings. I still have aboutfour exercise books covered with the words 'I love Archie', 'I LOVE Archie!', 'ILOVE ARCHIE!!!' on every page. On the cover of one of them is a huge crimsonheart with 'ARCHIE' emblazoned on it.</p><p>I remember when David and I were married and had our son,Jack, we kept a joint diary, but that was just full of lies because we eachknew the other one was going to read it. I had to keep a separate, secretdiary, because I felt so miserable about the whole marriage. In our joint diaryI wrote: 'Great day! We all went to the Round Pond with Jack and came back totea with Hughie and James. Lots of jokes and a splendid tea!' In my private oneI wrote: 'I just can't stand David and his horrible relations. I can't bear theway they all feel like a secret society I'm not part of. I want to be free! Iwant to dance! I want to have affairs!'</p><p>Of course, shortly after that, I did, and David and I brokeup, but oddly we stayed friends. (Anyway, God knows what he was writing in hissecret diary.) I also, even odder, stayed friendswith his half-brother, James, and his partner, Hughie. AND I stayed friendswith Archie, even though I never had an affair with him. When he marriedPhilippa, I was at his wedding, and we've had lunch every so often over theyears. It turned out that his firm in the City used Hughie as his solicitor&#x2013; he works in something mysterious called 'futures' &#x2013; so, as sooften happens, all my friends made a complete circle.</p><p> I didn't have time to keep a diary when I was at art school, or doing teachertraining, and it's only now I'm sixty &#x2013; well, I will be in a few months&#x2013; that I'm going to give it a go. I mean, properly give it a go. So...</p><p>October 8</p><p>Woke with watery eyes. Very bad sign. I meanit's OK to get them on a cold and windy day, or when something terrible hashappened like flu and you think you've got ME and will never be able to so muchas walk to the shops again, let alone lift up a telephone to moan to a friendabout being unable to walk to the shops again. But to get watery eyes for noreason &#x2013; ugh! I know a man of seventy whose eyes water so much he has adrip permanently on the end of his nose. It is, I fear, a sign of age.</p><p>It's like the time when I went to Dr Farmer recently with pains in my knees. 'Atouch of osteoarthritis, Marie,' she said. 'Happens at our age.'</p><p>When I explained that it couldn't happen to me because I never take any exercise andtherefore my knees ought, in theory, still to be in perfect nick, the knees ofa ten-year-old, barely used, exceptionally low mileage, one careful lady owner,I could probably even dig out the original box and receipt, she explained itdidn't work like that.</p><p>Rather a bore.</p><p>October 10</p><p>Have just come home, gasping with relief, from adinner party. I was hoodwinked into accepting the invitation because my oldfriend Marion rang using the well-worn trick: 'What are you doing on Thursday?'and instead of saying, cautiously: 'Why?', I fell into the trap.</p><p>'Nothing,' I said.</p><p>Clunk.</p><p>I suppose the odd dinner party can spring a wonderful surprise. And Marion, beingsomething of a wonder woman &#x2013; like cheese, she's always on a board&#x2013; has been known to produce interesting guests. But generally dinnerparties are like the lottery. You rarely win. The problem is first of all thereare never enough men, and, by now &#x2013; middle-aged, I was going to say, butperhaps the phrase 'getting on' might be more accurate &#x2013; the men who doattend are always spare for a very good reason: they are either completelyhopeless or completely mad.</p><p>(I'm not sure that description doesn't apply to most men, actually, whether they'respare or not, which is really why I've ended up so committed to being single.Doesn't mean some men aren't funny, sexy, kind and fascinating, but you can beall that and hopeless and mad at the same time.)</p><p>The second problem with dinner parties is that, as you get older, you don't &#x2013;well, I don't &#x2013; actually want to meet anyone new. There are quiteenough people I know whose friendship I would like to consolidate &#x2013; andother people's favourite people are very rarely my favourite people, and viceversa. The only new people I do want to meet are young people. But all old people wantto meet young people. We fall on them like vampires.</p><p>I remember myself, when about seventeen, being mobbed by men and women who, atfifty, seemed ancient. 'Do let me sit next to you!' they'd say, floppy lipsworking over tobacco-stained teeth set into receding gums. 'I do so love youngpeople!' And I would cringe as they hovered close, sucking into my youth,slavering over my peachy, blooming skin, my sadly immature views, myeverything.</p><p>'Do tell me why you like the messy look!'</p><p>'Why do you like young men with long hair?'</p><p>'Do explain the Beatles to me &#x2013; I do find them fascinating.'</p><p>'Don't you find mini-skirts rather cold</p><p>Do tell me &#x2013; what is this ''generation gap'' we hear so much about these days?'</p><p>Nowadays, I don't blame them, though I'd never be so overt in my own craving for the company of the young.</p><p>Yesterday I was talking to one of my best friends, Penny, and told her that yet anotherfriend of mine had died &#x2013; Philippa, actually, the wife of Archie who Ihad a crush on when I was a teenager. (She's the fourth to pop off this year. Ihave actually attended no fewer than five funerals since January.) And she saidthat six of her friends had died in the last eighteen months.</p><p>'The awful thing is,' she said, 'that now we just have to make do with the people who are left!'</p><p>'Unless,' I said, 'we cultivate young people.'</p><p>'Which we don't!' she said.</p><p>Well, I have to say I do, though the admission feels as sinful andhorrifically honest as getting up in an AA meeting and saying I'm an alcoholic.I mean, who is there going to be left when all around drop like leaves fromtrees in autumn? If I'm not one of the early droppers, I certainly don't wantto be hanging around on a bare branch, flapping away all dry and brown andlonely. I want some nice young green shoots around me.</p><p>Marion and her husband, Tim, live in a poky little Edwardian house in West London,still decorated with the Laura Ashley wallpaper that had once looked so prettyin the sixties. They are one of a group of friends of mine who seem to live inrock pools &#x2013; their sitting rooms could be scooped up, transported to theGeffrye Museum and displayed, along with beautifully preserved Elizabethanparlours and Georgian music rooms, as typical examples of mid-twentieth centurystyle.</p><p>The moment I entered the room (awash with grey heads) I knew I was in trouble. Youarrive at 8.15 and there is no way you can leave until after 11.00. Dinnerparties can be mini-prison sentences, only you don't get out early for goodbehaviour.</p><p>Things weren't helped by the arrival of a guest who wore her bag across her mackintoshfrom left shoulder to right hip &#x2013; presumably to make the chances ofgetting mugged less likely. To add to the general picture of insecurity, shehad her glasses on strings, another sign of age and madness. If you can't everfind your glasses, say I, then wear them all the time. If you have to, pushthem up on to your head. But don't have them hanging down on beaded strings. Itlooks as infantile as a three-year-old wearing gloves that are attached byribbons to his coat.</p><p>Because I used to teach art and so could, at a stretch, be regarded as someone in thehelping professions, my hosts had, at dinner, thoughtfully, they imagined, put,on my left, a male psychotherapist with a beard. Have to say I'm not mad aboutpsychotherapists. They always look unnaturally serene, never cross their legs,as if they've been Alexander-techniqued up to the eyebrows, which they probablyhave, and they always have sinisterly caring voices. I'm not actually crackersabout beards either, come to that. It's a truth, I've found, that men withbeards are never remotely sexy. I think they grow beards not to hide weakchins, but to hide their weak masculinity. Men with beards often seem to haverather large womanly bottoms.</p><p>This guy also had a lot of very white hair. There's something a bit fishy, I think,about a man clearly over sixty who has a lot of hair. He looked rather like aneffeminate sheep.</p><p>As we chomped our way through chilli con carne &#x2013; along with the house,Marion's cooking is also stuck in a seventies time-warp &#x2013; the therapistreferred occasionally to Freud. When he did, I heard myself saying, ratheracidly I'm afraid, that Freud was the most frightful old nightmare, who had,during his many incarnations, once recommended the taking of cocaine to hispatients. Indeed, for a while he had been a cocaine addict himself. Totalfraud.</p><p>'Are you sure you're not making a ''Fraudien'' slip?' asked the therapist. Everyonelaughed in the way English people do when given the chance to relieve thetiniest hint of either seriousness or unpleasantness in the conversation.</p><p>He chuckled in a knowing and patronizing way, therapist-style, and went back tohis salad. I was very pleased when a bit of lettuce got trapped in his beard.</p><p>I'm afraid I was in rather a bad mood. I had arrived in a bad mood. And the feelinghad been exacerbated long before the realization that my neighbour was atherapist by the fact that the hosts had placed in the middle of the table ahuge centrepiece of giant yellow and red tropical flowers, flanked on eitherside by tall candles, making it impossible for anyone on one side of the tableto see anyone on the other. The flowers were those weird kinds that look likepenises and vaginas &#x2013; only recently featuring on the floral scene andtotally ghastly. I managed, with a great show of jollity and apology, to getthe centrepiece moved. ('Oh, isn't it beautiful, but darling I want to see you when youtalk!'), but felt that I could hardly make demands about the candles too, soall the guests had to dodge round them to speak. Every time I looked across thetable I felt like a prisoner in Wormwood Scrubs.</p><p>Yes, bad mood. The older I get, the more of a loose cannon I become at dinnerparties. Nine times out of ten, I can shine and be good fun, but the tenth Istart yelling about inappropriate things, like how great euthanasia or abortionis, or how wrong it is to give aid to Africa, and everyone gets frightfully hotunder the collar and embarrassed. They say that this outspokenness is somethingto do with the synapses atrophying in the frontal lobes as you get older, but Ithink it's just the ludicrous confidence that comes with age. This time we goton to the subject, sparked off by Mrs Glasses-on-Strings revealing (as they sooften do these days) that, being sixty, she had just received her Freedom Pass,and how wonderful it was travelling on public transport for nothing.</p><p>I said I would be sixty in a few months, and couldn't wait.</p><p>'Yes,' said Mrs Glasses-on-Strings, trying to ingratiate herself with me. 'You're onlyas old as you feel. Sixty years young!'</p><p>'Sixty going on twenty!' said the therapist.</p><p>'I really can't agree,' I said. 'If you're sixty, you're sixty. Sixty is old. I amjust longing to be old, and I don't want to be told I'm young, when I'm not.I'm fed up with being young. Boring. I was young in the sixties, and once,believe it or not, I slept with a Beatle. Been there, got the teeshirt, worn itto death and put it in a bag for Age Concern. When I was twenty, sixty was old,when I was thirty, forty and fifty, sixty was still old. I'm not going tochange the goalposts now.'</p><p>'I'm sixty,' said Marion, as she smilingly collected the plates. (It's an odd factthat most men never realize when empty dishes are being stacked up. Thetherapist, who no doubt in his work prided himself on his acute sensitivity toother people's feelings, sat with his plate firmly in front of him, unawarethat major operations were being carried out that required his cooperation.)'But I don't feel a day over thirty!'</p><p>'But, Marion, don't you realize that that tragic?' I said. 'To continue feelingthirty for the whole of your life! So boring! A nightmare! I'm longing to feelsixty! What's wrong with that?'</p><p>'The great thing about age,' said the therapist, whose wife had finally leaned overthe table and taken his plate, 'is that it's never too late. You can do so manythings. Take an Open University degree, go bunjee-jumping, learn a new language...'</p><p>'But it is too late!' I argued. 'That's what's so great about being old. You nolonger have to think about going to university, or go bunjee-jumping! It's ahuge release! I've been feeling guilty about not learning another language formost of my adult life. At last I find that now, being old, I don't have to!There aren't enough years left to speak it. It'd be pointless!'</p><p>'Well, I feel,' said the therapist, defiantly, 'that now I am sixty-five, anything ispossible.'</p><p>'I find, approaching sixty,' I replied, 'that the great pleasure is that so manythings are impossible. I think,' I added, cruelly, putting my hand on hisarm and smiling a great deal to pretend I meant no harm, 'that you're in whatyou therapists call denial.'</p><p>This time I got the laugh, but it was cheap and I felt ashamed.</p><p>As I drove back I was sorry for the poor old therapist, finding himself sittingnext to rancid old me. Felt really guilty and horrible and wished I hadn't beenso acid. Like me, the poor man probably would have far preferred to have satnext to a lovely young person instead.</p><p>October 11</p><p>Woke feeling absolutely terrible, all the 1,001muscles in my face still trapped in a rictus of insincerity. Knew, even worse,that I would have to suffer this cramped feeling till the following morningwhen the poison of the ghastly evening had finally drained from my body.</p><p>To make matters worse, I looked terrible.

Culled from twenty-five years of lectures to spiritual seekers in the West and the East, these readings are expressed with the simplicity and authority of one who speaks from his own experience. What is purity of heart? It's a heart full of tranquility and peace. Having a steady mind, a balanced mind, is what you call purity of heart. You must be well balanced between the dualities: the ups and downs, the pleasure and pain, the profit and loss. If the mind is free from turbulence, then the seer can see its own nature. If your heart is pure and steady, you can see God reflected in that steady heart.</p><p>His Holiness Sri Swami Satchidanandais one of the most revered Yoga Masters of our time. A much-loved teacher, well known for his combination of practical wisdom and spiritual insight, he gave his life to the service of humanity, demonstrating by his own example the means of finding abiding peace. His message of peace, both individual and universal, has been heard worldwide. Each year, he received hundreds of invitations to speak at conferences, colleges, medical groups, and houses of worship around the globe.The following is the daily reading for February 7 from The Golden Present. <p> Let us talk a little bit about samadhi. In the yogic sense, we are talking about the transcendental state of enlightenment. But in India, normally if you say "he has attained samadhi". that means he has died and is buried. That is the normal connotation for that term. In a way, samadhi is like that. Your are dead, yet you are alive. My Master Sri Swami Sivanandaji used to sing this song: "When shall I see thee? When "I" ceases to be." He was asking this question of the Lord. "Lord, when can I see You? I know that will be when "I" ceases to be." That means that if the ego or "I" dies, you can truly live. </p><p> If the egoistic "I" goes away from you, you are free from the ego. You are clean, pure. At that stage you are fit to go to heaven, to experience the highest knowledge or the highest truth. That is what we call samadhi. This is the essence of all spiritual teachings and practices, no matter what the label. One can be a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, a Hindu, Buddhist, Moslem, or of any religion. Even if you don't have any faith at all or don't believe in any organized religion, it doesn't matter. That is not the criterion to have this realization. All you have to accomplish is to see that all selfishness goes away. </p><p> Where does the "I" dwell? In ego. Where does the ego live? In the mind. The ego is, in a way, the very source of mind. All the expressions of the ego, thinking, feeling, willing, could be put together under one term, "mind." If the mind gets completely purified, then it's no longer an obstruction to your experience of the Truth. When it is clean and clear, the mind doesn't color the appearance of the pure Self. It becomes a pure reflector of the Self to see its own true nature. that is the essence of spirituality.</p></p><h2>Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism</h2><p>Vampires are not just mythical creatures that come out and prowl for victims during a full moon.

Kennedy and Lem Billings: The Untold Story of an Extraordinary Friendship</h2><p>I'm not that kind of boy,&#x201d; Jack angrily wrote to Lem after his friend made a sexual advance. But Jack didn't end the relationship. From the time John F. Kennedy and Kirk LeMoyne Lem&#x201d; Billings met at Choate, until the President's assassination thirty years later, Jack and Lem remained best friends. Lem was a virtual fixture in the Kennedy family who even had his own room at the White House. Drawing on hundreds of letters and telegrams between the two, plus Lem Billings's oral history and interviews with family and friends like Ben Bradlee, Gore Vidal, and Ted Sorensen, award-winning Kennedy scholar David Pitts tells the story of an unusual friendship that endured despite an era of rampant homophobia.</p><p><b>David Pitts</b> has been senior writer at the U.S. Information Agency/Voice of America, and has written for publications including the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>. He lives in Washington, D.C.Freelance journalist Pitts thoroughly documents the long, intimate association of JFK and Kirk LeMoyne "Lem" Billings. The son of a Pittsburgh physician, Billings first met JFK in the early 1930s at Choate, where they systematically set about violating every campus rule possible. Although Lem was gay, their relationship was evidently always platonic and continued through WWII and after, as Billings pursued a career in advertising while also devoting much energy to advancing Kennedy's political career. Lem became an adored member of the extended Kennedy clan and loomed large in the lives of the children of the martyred Jack and Bobby. Billings also became a much-sought-after source, courted by dozens of Kennedy biographers until his death in 1981&#x2014;a devotee to the end and somehow incomplete as an individual separate from Jack. Gore Vidal, no friend of Lem's, belittled him, saying, "He's the guy who carries the coat.... He's the guy who runs errands.... To Jack, Lem was a kind of idiot friend." But Pitt, in a well-done first book, insists JFK had "absolute trust in Lem" though their friendship remained an enigma to others. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Having been arrested for Grand Theft Auto at the age of sixteen, his felony conviction prevents him from being what he always wanted to be: a police officer. So now he's out to prove to himself he truly is what he could've been. A cop. Even without a badge.</p><p>Screenwriter/Producer/Author&nbsp;Charles Kipps has won an Emmy, a Peabody, and an Edgar Award. His early career as a journalist, included a stint as Features Editor for <i>Variety</i>. &nbsp;He is the author of two non-fiction books, <i>Out of Focus</i> and <i>Cop Without A Badge</i>&nbsp;(recently reissued)<b>&nbsp;</b>and the novels <i>Hell's Kitchen Homicide </i>and <i>Crystal Death </i>(coming September 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kipps (Out of Focus) deftly labels Maher an "excitement junkie," and the aptness of that term is clear from the first paragraph of this high-speed bio. From a broken home, Maher early became addicted to fast cars, and at 17, driving a stolen car, he led police on a wild chase from the Bronx in New York City to the Catskills. For this he got a prison sentence of up to four years. After escape and re-incarceration, he had the good fortune to encounter detective Jim Doherty, who became a second father to him. He then built a career as a confidential informant for various police departments, the FBI and the DEA. His fascination with fast cars continuing, he met at a drag-racing strip the scion of one of Colombia's drug families and for several years was a serious cocaine addict whose habit wrecked his first two marriages and derailed his career as an informant. Eventually he conquered his addiction and now works for a security firm in New Jersey. From all the derring-do here emerges the portrait of a man who never grew up.

How he could justify himself and what he&#x2019;d done to those he loved.<br> <br>Every day he had lived with the constant fear that the police would catch onto him, that in spite of his best efforts he&#x2019;d left a clue somewhere, key evidence that would convict him.

Fifteen-year-old Bobby Pendragon arrives on this territory in pursuit of the evil Saint Dane, but all is peaceful on Veelox -- because it's deserted. The inhabitants have discovered a way to enter their own personal dream worlds, where they can be whoever they want, wherever they want. Their bodies lie in stasis while their minds escape to this dream realm. <br> Fresh from his battle with Saint Dane in 1937 Earth, Bobby is confident that they can defeat whatever Saint Dane has planned for this world. But once Bobby enters the virtual world will he be able to resist the lure of the ultimate in escapism?</p><p>Fifteen-year-old Bobby Pendragon has visited the alternate dimension of Denduron (<i>The Merchant of Death</i>), explored the endangered underworld territory of Cloral (<i>The Lost City of Faar</i>), and traveled back in time on his own planet Earth to uncover the evil plot of the fiendish Saint Dane--the evil force behind all these interworld exploits (<i>The Never War</i>). Now he "flumes" (a kind of time/space travel) into the territory of Veelox expecting to wage another battle against evil... only to find all is peaceful. He quickly discovers the peace is due to the fact that most of the citizens of Veelox have become addicted to Lifelight, a virtual reality lifestyle. Unfortunately, what once seemed so safe and enjoyable has taken a frightening twist, and Bobby must rely on a Veelox Traveler named Aja to help him find a solution--and save the territory. His antagonistic relationship with the brilliant Aja grates on his nerves as she spits out cryptic words of wisdom: "Salvation here can be found in only one place: the imagination. If you can't understand that, you might as well flume out right now."<p> Fans of D.J. MacHale's Pendragon series will enjoy this latest entry, and look forward to the forthcoming fifth title.

In Blessed Hanna Chrzanowska, RN: A Nurse of Mercy, discover the inspiring story of the first lay registered nurse to be beatified. <p> Before a nursing school existed in her native Poland, Hanna Chrzanowska (1902-1973) chose to become a professional nurse. After she helped tend to war refugees during World War II, her pioneering career shaped Polish nursing, serving to form countless students as she helped innumerable patients. </p><p> Above all, Hanna was a committed Christian who followed the Gospel call to love and serve one's neighbor, even when the Communist government of Poland made that difficult. With the help of hundreds of student volunteers, professional nurses, and committed lay and consecrated people of the Krakw Archdiocese, she established parish nursing in late 1950s Krakw and introduced homebound and disabled patients to retreats, home Masses, and re-integration into parish life. Blessed Hanna worked closely with Cardinal Karol Wojty&#x201a;a. It was largely under her influence that, years later, as Pope St. John Paul II, he designated the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes as the World Day of Prayer for the Sick. </p><p> Her canonization cause was opened at the request of her nursing colleagues, who knew she was a saint.</p></p><h2>Saints at the River: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>A major new Southern voice emerges in this novel about a town divided by the aftermath of a tragic accident--and the woman caught in the middle</b></p><p>When a twelve-year-old girl drowns in the Tamassee River and her body is trapped in a deep eddy, the people of the small South Carolina town that bears the river's name are thrown into the national spotlight.

More imaginative selections include how to wash your face (look up in the rain), how to watch where you&#x2019;re going (follow the movements of your shadow), and how to wonder (gaze at the night sky). Morstad&#x2019;s spare text and whimsical fine-line drawings with pastel enhancements portray children encountering new experiences enriched with whimsy and quiet wit. This guide will engage and delight youngsters. Ideal for one-on-one sharing, it will be read again and again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Starred Review - KIRKUS REVIEW<br> Smart, clean design and a text built around unpunctuated phrases offer room to pause, ponder and discuss in this book of quiet joy. Ample white space foregrounds a multicultural cast, whose patterned clothing, props and minimal, but visually exciting, settings take center stage. In the opening spread, &#x201c;how to go fast,&#x201d; readers consider options as eight youngsters whoosh by, one riding a scooter, another navigating stilts, a third sporting butterfly wings. The parade&#x2019;s leader is nearly off the page. &#x201c;How to see the wind&#x201d; prompts conversation about the kites, grass and hair shown at various angles&#x2014;and the metaphysical question itself. Morstad explores topics of interest to children, from &#x201c;staying close&#x201d; (two girls sharing one braid) to disappearing&#x2014;a scene in which meaning comes first from the curtained image; the text is nearly invisible. She intersperses colorful backgrounds, as well as single- and double-spread compositions for an overall effect that elicits anticipation at every turn. As in this Canadian&#x2019;s illustrations for the work of other authors (Caroline Woodward&#x2019;s Singing Away the Dark, 2010; Sara O&#x2019;Leary&#x2019;s When I Was Small, 2012), the characters&#x2019; delicate features exhibit an absorption in their activities that simultaneously signals the seriousness and satisfaction of concentration. The &#x201c;be happy&#x201d; conclusion portrays unself-conscious movement&#x2014;including that initial runner, leaving the book.<br> <br> Starred Review, Q &amp; Q<br> From the outset, it&#x2019;s clear that Julie Morstad&#x2019;s How To is a very special book. Each page features the Vancouver artist&#x2019;s trademark pen-and-ink drawings of kids just being kids: taking things slow (by lying in a field surrounded by butterflies, flowers, and tall grass), feeling the breeze (by riding a bike downhill), and making music (by whacking pots and pans with a spoon). All of Morstad&#x2019;s illustrations are beautifully realized, most of them with a spot of silliness that will keep young readers&#x2019; interest piqued just enough for that last, sleepy book before bedtime.<br> The first page sets the tone. Morstad&#x2019;s parade of kids trooping across the page give just a few examples of &#x201c;How to go fast,&#x201d; but serve to open the imagination to myriad others: walking, running, dancing, bouncing, or twirling, alone or in the company of friends. There are as many ways to go fast as there are kids to imagine them.<br> &#x201c;How to be brave&#x201d; and &#x201c;How to make friends&#x201d; might bring on misty eyes and a lump in the throat, while &#x201c;How to disappear,&#x201d; &#x201c;How to make a sandwich,&#x201d; and &#x201c;How to be a mermaid&#x201d; are guaranteed to elicit giggles, and are worth a try at playtime or in the bath.<br> Compared with countless books that try so very hard to teach a lesson or prove a point, this one delights with its easy, unforced relationship between words and pictures. The text is very short, but any parent craving something to talk to their child about at storytime will find opportunities to stretch it out &#x2013; children can discuss what makes them feel brave or happy, or describe the sensation of the wind on their skin. They can draw it. They can act it out. They can enjoy it, and so will you. Rarely are books so alive.<br> <br> ForeWord Magazine:<br> Another stunner from the gifted Julie Morstad. ""How To"" relays visual instructions on such events as washing your socks (stand in a puddle), watching the wind (fly kids), disappearing (hide behind a curtain), and watching where you're going (track your shadow). A perfect way to elevate familiar children's activities to capture their everyday magic. Innovative cropping of delicate drawings makes them even more precious.<br> <br> Deakin Review of Children's Literature 4/4 stars<br> Anyone who is a fan of creative and lateral thinking will love this book. The simple text and illustrations evoke complex connections and imagination. The title gives away that it is a &#x201c;how to...&#x201d; book but the things to do and learn are not your usual &#x201c;... make cookies&#x201d; or &#x201c;... build a birdhouse.&#x201d; I love that the text problems are answered by text-less illustrations. For example, &#x201c;how to make new friends&#x201d; is answered by an image of a child making sidewalk chalk drawings of various creatures (including people) and &#x201c;how to wash your socks&#x201d; is accompanied by a group of children stomping in a puddle of clean-looking water. While a few &#x201c;how to&#x2019;s&#x201d; are answered with several possibilities, most have only one. This might be considered a weakness or, on further reflection, the multiple-answer examples suggest a pattern so the reader will search for their own variations.<br> <br> I&#x2019;ll admit to some discomfort with the choice to make all the &#x201c;how to&#x201d; phrases unpunctuated and in lower case letters because I believe proper writing is learned through example. However, it is a tiny quibble about an inspirational book. I will be sure to feel the breeze and appreciate the face wash on my bike ride home in the rain.<br> <br> Reading Today - Best Back to School Books<br> How To vividly portrays the unlimited possibilities of imagination. Morstad represents a playful game through her illustrative narrative and adds poetic vibrancy with her words. Her gorgeous illustrations show how to do things in a number of ways such as going fast or slow, feeling a breeze, hiding, sleeping, making friends, and many other essential activities. All these small things fill up an ordinary day and make people happy. Starting with the book jacket, the author sets a joyful mood, which makes the reader wish to join the main characters. Morstad uses lines to not only animate her characters but also to provide an energetic and bright flow to her story. Thus, readers will be easily transported by the depicted scenes, and the book will become a must-have title for a classroom library.<br> Reviews for <i>The Swing</i>:<br> <br> ""The sensation of soaring through the skies is told in this classic poem that is given new life with beautiful drawings by an award-winning illustrator."" - <i>Today's Parent</i><br> <br> ""Evocative and mesmerizing all at once, this is one book that is sure to engage kids right from the get-go.

Chang's dream is to own a horse of his own. With luck ... and a little gold dust ... that wish just might come true.</p></p><p><p>Eleanor Coerr is the author of many books for young readers, including <em>The Big Baloon Race, </em>a Reading Rainbow book, <em>Chang's Paper Pony</em>, and <em>The Josefina Story Quilt</em>, a Notable Children&#x2019;s Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies.</p>It's the time of the Gold Rush in this I Can Read title; young Chang and his Grandpa Li work in the kitchen of the Gold Ditch Hotel in San Francisco. Since arriving from China, Chang has suffered indignities: he has been ostracized by American children and teased by the miners. Chang longs for a pony of his own, a pony to love and to ease the loneliness, but Grandpa says the only one they can afford is a paper onethe painting tacked above the stove. Kindly Big Pete, a miner, shows Chang how to dig and pan for gold, but he lacks enough for a pony. Then he finds gold dust where he least expects it. Although brief and simple, the story is rich in atmosphere, history and emotion. Coerr brings to young readers not only a satisfying tale, but a portrayal of an aspect of 19th century California history rarely attempted at this level. Ray's forceful drawings support the text well and firmly establish the dusty mining-town environment. She is particularly adept at showing the vulnerability of children, as well as the ways in which large and small joys affect them.

Your concern is love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>You've likely hit a snag, maybe a small one, maybe large. Human intimacy is so complex, so coiled and convoluted, that it's hard not to hit a snag. Most of us hit snags all the time in our dealings with others, especially those we are closest to. So, ifyou've hit a snag, just hang on. Keep up the effort. Anyone who tells you it's easy to stay together over the long haul has never done it. If you're still taking it seriously and working at it, your efforts will pay off as long as you have a plan that makessense. It's not enough just to take it seriously and work at it. Some people work at it their whole lives long and get nowhere. To help your efforts to keep your love alive and your marriage intact, we offer a plan based on what we know works best.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When a couple is in a good place, each partner feels secure and fulfilled. To feel secure and fulfilled in a relationship, both people need to feel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>* that the other person thinks highly of them. * that the other person cares deeply for them. *that the other person thinks they are proficient at something.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Beyond that, for love to become what we all want it to become, a smile should cross your face when you think of your mate. You ought to think of him or her as someone you have fun with, someone you look forward to seeing, someone who for an undefinablereason makes life feel special. You want to feel that he or she casts a glow into your life that makes you feel good, no matter what else might be going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When all goes right, a natural sequence of five steps leads to such happiness in love. Each step should usher in the next, but, as we will later describe, modern life tends to snag each one. The steps are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>1. Attention 2. Time 3. Empathy 4. Connection 5. Play&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Love begins in attention. Love begins when you notice another person. Love starts with a catching of your eye. Be it on some enchanted evening across a crowded room, or via an ad on Match.com, some signal--somehow--draws your attention to one person andnot to another. No one has ever figured out exactly why and how this happens when and where it does--but it does, and has done so since the dawn of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> In today's world, distractions interrupt attention all the time. The basic prerequisite of love--attention--can seem impossible to give or get.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Once you have each other's attention--no small feat--the next step toward love is to sustain that attention over time. Without sustained attention, love cannot grow. On the other hand, too much attention can snuff it out. While some people purport to knowthe right proportions in advance, each love is different, which is why there is no one recipe and why "prescriptions for finding love" offered by "experts" so often fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Giving and receiving attention becomes a kind of dance as love grows. Now you see me, now you don't. Playing hard to get. Don't be too easy. If you want me, you'll have to pursue me. At this stage, attention is often focused on the other in absentia. Resistingpicking up the phone to make the call. Deliberately avoiding the other person while thinking about him or her day and night. Preoccupied by the other person, but keeping a certain distance. This is the dance of developing love.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Once again, our age of distraction can disrupt the dance. If you don't have time to ponder and wonder, if you don't have time to approach and avoid and put your heart into it, then love will falter here, not because you are a mismatch but because you havenot created sufficient focus for love to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Attention given and received in proper measure over time, a recipe that varies from couple to couple, leads to a deeper interest in and a greater knowledge of the other person, which constitutes understanding and empathy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Mutual empathy creates a connection. It is impossible to overestimate the power of connection at its strongest. It drives life. But it cannot develop if people are unable to sustain attention over time. Such a mundane obstacle--distraction--ruins millionsof potentially intimate relationships in our modern age.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; But if you are able to create genuine connection, you've got it made. This is the great reward of love. In connection, you feel safe enough to become vulnerable. You feel safe enough to let go and to play. Play is the main action of true love. By playwe mean any activity in which your imagination comes alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Play often begets its cousin, celebration. New research shows that more important than being there for your partner when times are tough is being there for your partner when times are good. The study found that being excited and happy for your partnerwhen he or she brings home good news was a stronger predictor of the strength of the relationship than being stalwart when bad news hits.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Being able to play and to celebrate--being able to have fun together--are far more important than most people believe. They are a cornerstone of all great relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As we have mentioned and will continue to show, the conditions of modern life threaten all five of the steps we've named, which in turn threatens the vibrancy and power of your love--not because you are mismatched, not because you are impaired people,but simply because today's world sets unique traps that can derail even the best relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Of course, we don't know exactly how the help you'll find here will help you because we don't know the particulars of your situation. You may be in great distress, or just a little worried. Whatever the case, you probably want to get more from your marriage(or other close relationship) than you are currently getting. This book will help you in that regard. If you follow the suggestions we offer in these pages, it will be impossible for you not to develop a closer and more enjoyable relationship. And don't worry,the suggestions are not at all difficult to implement. You won't have to learn a foreign language or join a new religion. All you really have to do is set aside some time. Not easy, but possible, right? &nbsp; You may believe your marriage is basically good, but it could use a tweak. Or you might feel like the person who once said to Ned, "I know my marriage is just fine . . . until I stop and think about it."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> There is likely love in your marriage, and we will build on that love. But even if you think there is no love, we will help you search out what's positive. At the heart of our method is the identification and development of what's already good. You wouldn'tbe with your partner if you didn't once have love, or something like love, but that love might now not be so easy to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> As one of Ned's patients once said, "My husband and I work so hard to get everything done, we're like a small business, and businesses don't run on love. Earn the money, take care of the kids, keep up the house, do the holidays and birthdays and celebrations,bake the cookies, do the school and homework thing, keep up with the relatives, you know the drill. With all there is to get done, I sometimes ask myself, 'But where's the love?' You know, like, get real, who has time for that?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> At times we're simply too busy to pay attention to the people we love the most. We take them for granted. There's just so much to do. You may be exasperated at how difficult it has become to get your spouse's full attention or to find some enjoyable chunksof time for yourselves together, time when you're both fully present.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Life has also become so insecure, so fraught with worry and uncertainty, that it can be difficult to connect romantically. You may feel as if you are handling one crisis after another, or at best, one worry after another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> We do live in worried times. So, you're probably not only looking for deeper love but also for greater stability . . . in a world where neither love nor stability is easy to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> You also may be hoping for some fun. But today, fun often gives way to fear. As you read this, you may be wondering if any of the hopes we've mentioned are realistically possible given the frenzy and anxiety of modern life and all the stuff you have todo just to stay afloat. Marital bliss may seem like a preposterous pipe dream, not an attainable goal. &nbsp; Perhaps marital bliss is hyperbole, but genuine joy in a marriage is a goal that we believe any person can reach. We believe the pipe dream is not preposterous. We will show you what you can do to overcome many of the obstacles marriages and other intimaterelationships face these days.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> We want to connect with you, no matter where you are emotionally. As we wrote the book, we always imagined your side of the conversation, your concerns, your needs, and we tried to anticipate what you might want to know. We've looked at marriage in a moderncontext, your context.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> One of the most jarring facts about modern life is how angry, contentious, and unfriendly it can be. Thanks to technology, we live in an age of instant gotcha!--an age of nonstop gossip and muckraking streaming endlessly across screens worldwide, an ageof disappearing privacy and mounting mistrust, an age of witty ridicule in which the clever put-down gets attention, while the pat on the back seems hokey and obsolete.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Yet, most of us would like a pat on the back as well as some harmony in our lives. Aren't you tired of exposes, fallen heroes, corrupt leaders, and broken promises? Wouldn't you like someone you can truly believe in? Don't look at the news to find thatperson. Look homeward. Look to your friends. Most of all, look to your mate. These days it is best to create your own safe haven, your own network of positive connections, your local protection against the storm of data and disappointments we call the news.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; In addition to distemper, our age is unique in its unprecedented levels of distraction and worry. Our daily lives so burst with information and random, ominous data that for a fact, opinion, or idea to penetrate past our eyeballs and into our minds, itmust arrive at high speed with armor-piercing barbs. Friendliness is too slow and unbarbed to get in. There's no "hook" to civility. That's why it's going the way of the rotary telephone and the handwritten thank-you note. We need noise, conflict, bad news,disagreement, another person's pain, even our own pain . . . then we pay attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As such rancor rises, many of us feel an unmet need for some kind words, but we hesitate to ask for them or even to offer them, lest we seem feeble, passe, or vulnerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Yet the success of marriages and all other close relationships depends upon slowing down enough and opening up enough to create a space that welcomes simple, kind words. Such words are hard to find "out there." We will help you find them and create them,wherever you may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Unlike the dream of getting rich, or getting famous, or winning the Nobel Prize, or making it to the major leagues, or living to the age of 110, the dream of love is a dream every person in the world can make come true. Don't give up on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If you've read this far, you haven't. &nbsp; But you're a little frustrated--or maybe a lot frustrated--with your difficulty in turning your relationship into what it could be or keeping it where you want it to be. Warmth and intimacy require daily effort . . . but who has time? There are biggerworries to worry about than love. You resonated with the title, Married to Distraction, and thought to yourself, "Yes! That's it! It's that simple, but that difficult! If we could just make each other a priority . . . if we could just connect for more thana minute or two . . ."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; You may be frustrated by your partner's tendency to disappear, literally or figuratively, in the middle of what you thought was an important conversation or project. You're probably wondering what in the world you have to do to hold on to his or her attentionlong enough to connect in the ways you so dearly want to connect. You may be trying to figure out how you, yourself, can be more mentally present and engaged with the person or people you love, while still doing all the gazillion things that you have to doevery day. There's so much to worry about. Where can love fit in? Isn't love a luxury, a frill for the idle rich? (Lest you believe that, by the way, one of the few rock-solid findings in sociology is the lack of correlation between wealth and happiness. Onceyour income rises above the poverty level, increasing levels of income do not predict increasing levels of joie de vivre. Sure, we'd all like to be part of the experiment, but it's been done, and done many times!)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>You may also wonder if you simply want too much from your marriage. You may say to yourself, "Maybe this day-to-day distance is what a real-life relationship is usually like. Perhaps I just need to face that romance is for fairy tales and real life ismore like novels where everyone is unhappy and frustrated, and the smartest characters are the ones who accept the unavoidable limitations of life. Maybe the best I can hope for is to avoid disasters and make do with what I've got."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Even so, you do want more. That is a healthy instinct, not a greedy one. It is good to want the most from love. You don't want to give up on your dream, and you shouldn't. You wonder why you have to spend so much time doing grunt work, tending to the choresof life--from taking out the trash to getting people to where they need to be to paying bills to getting the dog's claws clipped--and have so little time to enjoy the closeness you desire in your number one relationship. You may feel that a feast is going onin the main room, but you're always stuck eating in the kitchen alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> You may feel as if you carry far more than your fair share of the workload, and you're more than just a little bit tired of it. You want to be part of a connected team, not two people working in parallel. You want to enjoy the feast together. As well youshould! &nbsp;</p><h2>The Fairy Tales of Hans Christian Andersen</h2><p><br><strong>The cornerstone of modern fantasy...An exciting new compilation of Hans Christian Andersen&#x2019;s world-famous fairy tales</strong><br><br><em>The Fairy Tales of Hans Christian Andersen</em> presents<strong> the most famous Andersen stories</strong>, including classics such as &#x201c;The Little Mermaid&#x201d;, &#x201c;The Ugly Duckling&#x201d;, and &#x201c;The Princess and the Pea,&#x201d; in a highly esteemed 1942 translation by Jean Hersholt.

In it, I explore the real, factual history of the Tarot (No one knows, and does it really make any difference?) as well as a chapter about the theories of the history of the Tarot in general, and a recounting of the history of the Robin Wood Tarot. There is a description of the symbolism that is common to most decks, along with a listing of the symbols that are used in the Robin Wood Tarot in particular. The bulk of the book is a description of each card; including a verbal key to help the Reader remember the meaning, a synopsis of what the card might mean in a reading, and a complete description of what is on the card and why I put it there. This is followed by a short discussion of how the Tarot works, how to begin to read (including a section on Grounding and Centering,) and an exploration of the Ethics of reading the Tarot. Finally, there is a short section about spreads. (It&#39;s short, because the book quickly became much longer than I expected!) And, in the very back, there are a few appendices which go into more detail about some of the stories and legends that are mentioned in the book, as well as a section covering the Rules of Tarocchi!</p><p></p><h2>The Painter&#39;s Apprentice: A Novel of 16th-Century Venice (Venetian Artisans)</h2><p><b>Would you rather sacrifice your livelihood, your lover, or your life?</b> <p></p><p><b>When the Black Death comes knocking on your door, you'd better decide quickly.</b> </p><p></p><p>ERIC HOFFER GRAND PRIZE FINALIST </p><p></p><p>EDITOR'S CHOICE, HISTORICAL NOVELS REVIEW </p><p></p><p> <em>Venice, 1510.</em> Maria Bartolini wants nothing more than to carry on her father&#x2019;s legacy as a master gilder.

Be as critical as you like&#39; - Pep Guardiola to Marti Perarnau, summer 2013 Marti Perarnau was given total access to Bayern Munich during season 2013-14. This book represents the first time in the modern era that a writer has got this close to one of the elite teams of world football. At the invitation of Pep Guardiola, he shadowed the Catalan, his staff and his superstar players during training and on matchdays. Bayern smashed domestic records on their way to the double, but were humiliated by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final. Perarnau was with them every step of the way. Perarnau is with Guardiola as he is courted by the world&#39;s greatest clubs during his sabbatical in New York. We hear Guardiola explain in detail the radical tactical moves which transform Bayern&#39;s season and reprogramme the players who will win the World Cup with Germany.Perarnau talks exclusively and in fascinating detail with players such as Arjen Robben, Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Thiago Alcantara and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

His Malazan Book of the Fallen series, including <i>The Crippled God</i>, <i>Dust of Dreams</i>, <i>Toll the Hounds</i> and <i>Reaper's Gale</i>, have met with widespread international acclaim and established him as a major voice in the world of fantasy fiction. The first book in the series, <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>, was shortlisted for a World Fantasy Award. The second novel, <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>, was voted one of the ten best fantasy novels of 2000 by SF Site. He lives in Canada.</p>This collection of edgy and violent narratives tied to Erikson's Malazon Empire series pushes the boundaries of epic fantasy with morally ambiguous protagonists, bloody altercations and gritty world-building. Bauchelain, a cultured necromancer; Korbal Broach, his eunuch companion with an intense desire to procreate; and their luckless manservant, Emancipor Reese, find themselves embroiled in a murder mystery in Blood Follows, a shipboard battle against unearthly powers in The Lees of Laughter's End, and the politics of a fascist kingdom in The Healthy Dead. Through short, clipped chapters, a focus on gore-filled action and an economy of words, Erikson moves the plots quickly. A bit of ironic dark humor adds needed levity to otherwise disturbing, even sordid stories enthralled with the seedy side of human nature. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What kind of family must she come from? How could she get into this country? What is the true price she must pay to remain in the United States?</b><br><br> JULISSA ARCE knows firsthand that the most common, preconceived answers to those questions are sometimes far too simple-and often just plain wrong.<br><br> On the surface, Arce's story reads like a how-to manual for achieving the American dream: growing up in an apartment on the outskirts of San Antonio, she worked tirelessly, achieved academic excellence, and landed a coveted job on Wall Street, complete with a six-figure salary. The level of professional and financial success that she achieved was the very definition of the American dream. But in this brave new memoir, Arce digs deep to reveal the physical, financial, and emotional costs of the stunning secret that she, like many other high-achieving, successful individuals in the United States, had been forced to keep not only from her bosses, but even from her closest friends.<br><br> From the time she was brought to this country by her hardworking parents as a child, Arce-the scholarship winner, the honors college graduate, the young woman who climbed the ladder to become a vice president at Goldman Sachs-had secretly lived as an undocumented immigrant. In this surprising, at times heart-wrenching, but always inspirational personal story of struggle, grief, and ultimate redemption, Arce takes readers deep into the little-understood world of a generation of undocumented immigrants in the United States today- people who live next door, sit in your classrooms, work in the same office, and may very well be your boss. By opening up about the story of her successes, her heartbreaks, and her long-fought journey to emerge from the shadows and become an American citizen, Arce shows us the true cost of achieving the American dream-from the perspective of a woman who had to scale unseen and unimaginable walls to get there.</p><p>JULISSA ARCE is a writer, speaker, and social-justice advocate.

He knows everything about it: the battles, the generals, every movement of the Union and Confederate Armies. So when the last assignment of seventh-grade history is a project on the Civil War, Oliver is over the moon--until he's partnered with Ella Berry, the slacker girl with the messy hair who does nothing but stare out the window. And when Oliver finds out they have to research a random soldier named Private Raymond Stone who didn't even fight in any battles before dying of some boring disease, Oliver knows he's doomed. <br><br>But Ella turns out to be very different from what Oliver expected. As the partners film their documentary about Private Stone--with Oliver's friend Kevin signing on as their head writing consultant--Oliver discovers that sometimes the most interesting things are hiding in uninteresting places. Even Private Stone is better than expected: There's a mystery buried in his past, and Oliver knows he can figure it out.</p><p>Matthew Landis slays boredom wherever it lurks in his eighth-grade social studies classroom. He lives in Doylestown, PA, with his wife and four kids, some chickens, and a boxer that acts much like the forgotten eldest child.<p><b>-Chapter One-</b></p><p><b>The Project</b></p><p>Oliver knew Samantha wouldn&#x2019;t know.</p><p>He asked anyway.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that Union General Ulysses S. Grant and Confederate General Robert E. Lee both went to West Point?&#x201d;</p><p>Samantha whipped her dark hair back and copied down the homework posted on Mr. Carrow&#x2019;s PowerPoint slide. Oliver had already done that. He was always the first one to his table in social studies and always had the homework copied down before Mr. Carrow started the welcome music.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Grant was an average student, but crazy-good at riding horses. Lee graduated second in his class.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And they both fought in the Mexican-American War.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really. I mean think about that&#x2014;two guys who went to the same military school and fought the same enemy fighting <i>each other</i> in the Civil War. How crazy is that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;</p><p>Samantha swiveled around to talk with a girl at the next table. Oliver didn&#x2019;t really mind. Not everyone got how awesome the Civil War was, and that was okay. Awesome things still needed saying, and so he&#x2019;d keep saying them.</p><p>&#x201c;Grab a seat, gang,&#x201d; Mr. Carrow called over the indie rock music he blared pretty much every day. He was wearing a blazer, which meant they were starting a new unit.</p><p>&#x201c;Lots to do, lots to do. So much that we probably won&#x2019;t even get started and you&#x2019;ll all fail the fourth marking period. Won&#x2019;t that be sad. Probably get some emails from parents. Not yours, Tara&#x2014;they gave up on you long ago.&#x201d;</p><p>Laughter rippled through the class.</p><p>&#x201c;But seriously, today is a big day. Maybe the biggest in your seventh-grade career. There is a small chance that you&#x2019;ll look back on this day and say, &#x2018;That was the greatest day of my life: the day we launched our study of the American Civil War.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Oliver pulsed with excitement. <i>Finally. </i>They were going to study the thing he&#x2019;d dedicated his life to. This was his arena&#x2014;there was no chance of him not getting a hundred percent on this project. He would dominate and love every second of it.</p><p>&#x201c;I promise that your Civil War experience will not be the one I had in seventh grade&#x2014;memorizing endless battles, dates, and generals.&#x201d; Mr. Carrow&#x2019;s eyes swept past Oliver, landing for just a second. &#x201c;Battles are important, and we&#x2019;ll study some of the big ones. And the generals who conducted the war were very interesting people, and we&#x2019;ll look at some of them too. But to really understand the impact of the conflict you need to look at the regular people&#x2014;the soldiers, nurses, and slaves. You have to look at the mothers, daughters, and sons on the home front, and free African Americans in the North. What was the war like for them? The combined answer to <i>that</i> gives us a much better understanding of the war.&#x201d;</p><p>Oliver&#x2019;s grin turned into a flat stare. He couldn&#x2019;t really disagree with Mr. Carrow; the teacher was a master of history. Literally&#x2014;he had a degree that said master&#x2019;s in history. But Oliver didn&#x2019;t really get why he was downplaying battles, dates, and generals. Those things were what the war was made of. Oliver should know.</p><p>&#x201c;Now: We&#x2019;ve got a seasoned Civil War buff in our midst&#x2014;someone to fill us in when the textbook can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Mr. Carrow smiled at Oliver. &#x201c;Ollie, I hope you can give me some additional info when we dig into the battles.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, yeah.&#x201d; Oliver nodded. Okay. So all wasn&#x2019;t lost.</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect. I want to lay out your unit project first. This is the lens that we&#x2019;re going to use to view the entire war.&#x201d; Mr. Carrow rapped his knuckles on a stack of worksheets. &#x201c;Table captains, come and get &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>Oliver basically ran up to the front table. He might have shoved Ian out of the way. He handed the worksheets out to his table and speed-read the directions.</p><p>And he loved it all&#x2014;almost. There was one issue: It was a partner project.</p><p>But Oliver had found ways around that before. He wasn&#x2019;t worried.</p><p>&#x201c;Maggie, read the directions for us, would you?&#x201d; Mr. Carrow asked.</p><p>Maggie&#x2019;s straight black hair fell into her face as she leaned toward the paper. <i>&#x201c;With a partner, explore the wartime experience of a Civil War contemporary.

Why <i>wouldn&#x2019;t</i> he do a trifold. He could fill it with tons of information and stand beside it dressed in his Civil War uniform. Maybe he could even bring his bayonet.</p><p>&#x201c;Do we get to choose our partners?&#x201d; asked Tommy.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s vote on it,&#x201d; Mr. Carrow said. &#x201c;Just kidding. This isn&#x2019;t a democracy&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a somewhat benevolent dictatorship. Ian, I will define &#x2018;benevolent&#x2019; for you after class. Dictator says, yes, you may choose your partners. But I reserve the right to reject any partnerships that could be harmful to your grade or my own sanity or both. You&#x2019;ve got two minutes to figure that out. Go.&#x201d;</p><p>Oliver pretended not to hear the directions. While everyone else ran to a best friend or scavenged the wasteland of leftover partners, he stuck to his seat. He began to sketch the layout of his trifold.</p><p>&#x201c;Oliver, over here.&#x201d; Mr. Carrow waved at him from a back table. &#x201c;Need your help.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Yes. </i>His abilities were already in demand.</p><p>Mr. Carrow motioned to the only student at the table. She was Oliver&#x2019;s height but way skinnier. She was a beanstalk wearing too-big wrinkled jeans, a stained T-shirt, and a facial expression that wasn&#x2019;t exactly a frown but close enough. Thick brown hair that she never brushed hung in her eyes.</p><p>She was Ella Berry.</p><p>&#x201c;I want you two to work together,&#x201d; Mr. Carrow said.</p></p><h2>An Introduction to Cybernetics</h2><p>2015 Reprint of 1956 Printing.

Unexpectedly, Alec receives word that the sheikh has died and has left the Black to Alec. A race between the Black and Satan is inevitable, but unexpected events put the horses in the path of a raging forest fire. Suddenly, they are racing for their lives.</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.Triple Crown<br><br>1<br><br>Alec Ramsay sat still and straight in his saddle, seemingly unaware of the thousands of eyes upon him. He wore black racing silks, and beneath his peaked cap the whiteness of his face made a startling contrast to his racing colors and the burly black horse beneath him.<br><br>They were third in the parade to the post for the running of the classic Belmont Stakes. Alec wished they had drawn an outside position instead of the number 3 slot. He didn't like being so near the rail. Henry's instructions were to hold Satan until the field approached the middle of the backstretch before making his move. It would have been easier to do this from an outside post position.<br><br>The parade had passed the clubhouse and was now opposite the grandstand. Alec didn't have to look to know that it was overflowing with people. The tumultuous roar from the stands took care of that. And he knew their eyes were upon Satan, wondering if the big three-year-old would win the Belmont Stakes, as he had won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, to take his place among the few great horses of the turf who had captured the Triple Crown! They wondered only because of the condition of the track. It was ankle-deep in mud after a heavy morning rain, and the early June sky was still overcast as a fine drizzle fell.<br><br>The last remaining doubters of Satan's greatness asked themselves, "But can he race in the mud? He never has, you know."<br><br>Alec's hand went to the thick, muscular neck of the colt as Satan sidestepped quickly to the middle of the track. He spoke to him, and the heavy ears swept back at the sound of his voice; then the restlessness left Satan's giant body and he was back in line as the field continued parading past the stands.<br><br>From the pushing, heaving wave of people at the rail, a man shouted, "Hey, Ramsay! You think it's a horse show?"<br><br>Alec heard the man's words, but his eyes never left the muddy track which he could see between Satan's pricked ears.<br><br>"A Good Hands class maybe?" the man called again.<br><br>Only then did Alec Ramsay become aware that he was sitting much straighter in his saddle than the other jockeys. The whiteness of his skin gave way to a sudden flush of color, but his seat remained unchanged. He couldn't have sat his horse any other way.<br><br>"Bring him home, Alec!" someone else shouted. "Bring him home like you did in the Derby an' the Preakness!"<br><br>The post parade ended when they had filed past the stands, and Alec allowed Satan to go into a slow gallop. He rose in his stirrups and leaned forward, his face pressed close to the colt's bulging neck.<br><br>Henry had said Satan could race in the mud as well as on a dry track. Henry should know, for he had been training Satan all winter and spring while Alec had spent most of his time in school. Henry said they had worked Satan in all kinds of weather and the big-boned colt didn't know the difference between a dry track and a wet one. Alec had to take Henry's word for it. He'd raced Satan only twice this year, once in the Kentucky Derby and again in the Preakness. The track had been dry and fast for each race, and Satan had had no trouble winning by many lengths.<br><br>He took the big black colt to the outside rail and went past the two horses in front of him. He let him go far around the turn, finding reassurance in the ever-lengthening and confident strides of the colt as he galloped fetlock-deep in the mud. And Alec thrilled to the swift and thunderous movement beneath his knees. But finally he rose still higher in his stirrups and drew back on the reins until Satan had slowed to a prancing crabstep.<br><br>He turned the colt to find the others already on their way back to the starting gate, now set in front of the grandstand. He kept Satan to a slow trot, and his hand slid down the thick neck before him. High above Satan's craned head, Alec saw the many cameras set up on the top tier of the grandstand; they were trained on the field as it went to the post.<br><br>"Easy does it, Satan," he said as one of the starter's crew took hold of the bridle. Prancing, pulling a little, Satan moved inside the gate. The door behind them was closed; there was only one way out of the stall now.<br><br>For a moment, there were the heavy thuds of hoofs against stalls and the soft whisperings of jockeys to their mounts; all accompanied by the loud, shrieking clamor from the crowd, awaiting the break. Then, very abruptly, a heavy silence fell over the great stands, a silence which finally descended to the starting gate.<br><br>Only Satan's big ears moved. Restlessly they pitched forward, then came back until they were flat and heavy against his head. Alec felt the tenseness of the giant colt beneath him. Close to Satan's head he whispered to him. The break would come any second now, any second and they would be off.<br><br>"A mile and a half this time, Satan," he said softly. "It's a little longer than the others. Plenty of time for you. Easy getting away, Satan. Easy now . . . wait for me."<br><br>The grilled doors clanged open; the starting bell rang. There was an outcry from more than fifty thousand voices that was quickly pommeled to deadening silence by racing, pounding hoofs.<br><br>Satan broke with the others, took two fast strides and stumbled! Alec felt his head go down, gave him more rein, then drew back, helping Satan to recover his feet. There was a sickening second of sliding, thrashing hoofs seeking foothold in the mud. Satan's strides came fast and short as he tried to control the hurtling momentum of his heavy body over the slippery track. Alec felt the straining of the great muscles beneath him. He was afraid to move lest he offset Satan's balance still more. He gave the colt his head, yet Alec's hands on the reins were ready to help Satan when he needed it.<br><br>Satan's strides were unrhythmic as he plunged forward, but Alec knew the worst was over. The big black colt had gathered himself and his feet were firmly beneath him once more. Even now his strides were lengthening, his body leveling out.<br><br>Only then did Alec become conscious of the heaving, sleek bodies to the front and side of him. The start on the muddy track had been difficult for all the horses, but now each was in his stride and moving fast.<br><br>Satan's head was pushed forward and he was pulling. Bending low to the side of the black neck, Alec drew back on the reins. "Not yet, Satan. Not yet," he called.<br><br>Driving hindquarters rose and fell in front of them, sending mud into their faces. Satan didn't like it, but he didn't attempt to free himself from Alec's tight rein.<br><br>The three leading horses swung into the first turn, followed by Satan and the rest of the field. Alec saw the jockeys on his right starting to close in on him; they wanted to bring their mounts into the rail ahead of Satan going around the turn. Momentarily he gave Satan more rein. The colt surged forward, keeping the rail. But the others held on, pressing Satan as he sped about the turn.<br><br>The leaders were four lengths ahead as Satan came into the backstretch. Alec took a firm hold, keeping the black colt just to the fore of those running behind him.<br><br>"Make your move in the middle of the backstretch," Henry had said. "Not before then. It's only the gray you have to worry about, and he'll be back with you, biding his time."<br><br>The gray colt was behind him, as Henry had said. Alec could see his head coming up close beside them. He gave Satan a little more rein to keep ahead of the gray.<br><br>The leaders, having spent their early speed, were dropping back, and Satan bore down upon them with giant strides. But the gray was still pressing the black colt. Together they passed the tiring horses who had set the pace. Together they swept by the half-mile pole and drove toward the far turn.<br><br>No mud flew in Alec's face now. The track ahead was clear of horses and only the racing gray, moving at Satan's hindquarters, could keep the black colt from winning the Triple Crown!<br><br>"Now, Satan!" Alec shouted into the wind.<br><br>He moved forward and the white rail went by with ever increasing speed. Alec bent low, lost in the colt's heavy, flowing mane. Nothing could stop Satan now, for he was running free, and there was a savage wildness to his action.<br><br>For only a few yards did the gray match Satan's tremendous strides. Then he fell back before the fresh onslaught of speed and power displayed by the black colt. And as Satan rounded the turn in all his fury and came down the homestretch, the eyes of the crowd were on him alone. He was all power, all beauty as he swept beneath the wire, winner by a dozen lengths and the first undefeated Triple Crown winner in turf history!<br><br>High on the roof above the stands, a man kept his camera on Satan until the black colt was brought to a stop far up the track; then, turning to another cameraman, he said, "Never in my life have I seen a horse run like that. Never."<br><br>"I have," the other returned. "But only once. He was the Black, the sire of this colt. Alec Ramsay was up on him, too. That kid's life is like something out of a movie," he concluded, shaking his head.<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"You mean you don't know his story? Where've you been?"<br><br>"In Peru, shooting Inca ruins for the last five years."<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>"What's the story?"<br><br>"Alec Ramsay and the Black were the lone survivors of a shipwreck, and the kid brought him home. It turned out that Henry Dailey, the old trainer, whom everyone had just about forgotten, was a neighbor of Alec Ramsay. And when Henry saw the Black he knew what the kid had hold of. They kept the Black in what's no more than a back lot over in Flushing; then they sprung him in that big match race that was arranged for Sun Raider and Cyclone a few years back, and he whipped them both. I saw him do it. It's the only time he raced, but I'll never forget him." The cameraman turned toward the track and Satan. "They could have been one and the same horse today," he added.<br><br>"But what happened to the Black?"<br><br>"As I heard it, an Arab chieftain by the name of Abu Ishak turned up not long after the match race and proved the horse was his. So he took the Black back to Arabia."<br><br>"And that's the end of the Black?"<br><br>"It is, as far as I know."<br><br>"But where does Satan come in? How did Alec Ramsay get hold of him?"<br><br>"The story goes that this Abu Ishak promised the kid he'd send him the first foal by the Black. He kept his promise. Satan is that foal."<br><br>"What a break for the kid."<br><br>"Yeah. He and Henry Dailey raised Satan in the same lot where they'd kept the Black. They brought him out in the Hopeful last fall. You know the rest . . . he hasn't been beaten yet."<br><br>"From back lot to undefeated Triple Crown champion," the other cameraman mused as he turned to the winner's circle, where Alec Ramsay sat on Satan amidst a crowd of photographers. "He's riding high in the big time now. No more back lots for Alec Ramsay. Lucky kid!"<br><br>Lucky Alec Ramsay?<br><br>2<br><br>Alec Ramsay closed the door of the jockeys' bungalow behind him, muffling the shrill voices which rose above the hiss of showers. Standing on the porch, he looked across the wet and empty courtyard to the hoof-furrowed ground of the paddock's walking ring. And his gaze stayed there while he slipped his long arms into the sleeves of his raincoat and drew the belt about him. Then he went down the steps into the steady drizzle.<br><br>As he walked to the gate in the iron fence, his hatless head was tucked deep within his coat collar, so he did not see the tall, solitary figure that stood in the rain awaiting him.<br><br>"Alec," the man called as the boy stepped outside.<br><br>"Dad! I thought you and Mother would be over at the barn with Henry."<br><br>"Mother's there," his father said. "She sent me with this." Casually he lifted an unopened umbrella.<br><br>Alec turned from it to the water dripping from the rim of his father's hat. "Why aren't you using it, then?" he said with a smile. "You must have been waiting a long time."<br><br>"Never did like them. Do you want it?"<br><br>Alec shook his head. "We can put it up before we get to the barn," he said.<br><br>They walked past the empty stands, and only the litter strewn about gave evidence of the thousands who had occupied the seats an hour ago. The lights gleamed fuzzily in the rain.<br><br>"I don't need to tell you that it was a great race, Alec," Mr. Ramsay said. "A truly great one. He's unbeatable." He put his arm across the boy's shoulders as he turned to him, smiling.<br><br>Alec's head was down, his eyes on the wet pavement. "Satan never makes a wrong move and will do anything you ask of him," he said in a low, even voice. "Henry has done a wonderful job training him, Dad. Satan will go for anyone now . . . anyone who will just sit there and tell him what to do. He's come a long way since . . ." Alec stopped without finishing his sentence.<br><br>Mr. Ramsay's face sobered. "You've done your part making him what he is today," he said quickly. "Don't you forget that, Alec--not for one moment. He was a pretty bad colt before you taught him to have confidence and trust in human beings. Henry's gone on from where you left off. He's made a superb racing machine of Satan, but always remember he couldn't have done it without your help."<br><br>"Sure, Dad," Alec said. "I'll remember."<br><br>They had passed the stands, and their eyes now turned to the long rows of barn sheds a short distance away.

Just fine, except for Satan's stumble at the break. But she came out of it as well as he did. And when the race was over I heard her telling the people sitting next to us that your hands kept Satan on his feet.

The dry soil didn&#x2019;t seem to have dimmed the color of the petals. <i>Not particularly showy flowers, but they&#x2019;re tough,</i> Ayane thought, gazing out onto the veranda through the sliding glass door. <i>I&#x2019;ll have to water them when I get a chance.</i><br>&#x201c;Have you heard a single word I&#x2019;ve said?&#x201d; Yoshitaka asked.<br>She turned around and smiled faintly. &#x201c;Yes, everything. How could I not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You might try answering more quickly, then.&#x201d; Yoshitaka, lounging on the sofa, uncrossed and recrossed his long legs. In his frequent workouts, he took pains not to put on too much lower-body muscle&#x2014;nothing that would prevent him from wearing the slim-cut dress pants he preferred.<br>&#x201c;I suppose my mind must&#x2019;ve wandered.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh? That&#x2019;s not like you.&#x201d; Her husband raised a single sculpted eyebrow.<br>&#x201c;What you said was surprising, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I find that hard to believe. You should be familiar with my life plan by now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Familiar&nbsp;... Maybe so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you trying to say?&#x201d; Yoshitaka leaned back and stretched his arms out along the sofa top, ostentatious in his lack of concern. Ayane wondered if he was acting or if he truly was that nonchalant.<br>She took a breath and stared at his handsome features.<br>&#x201c;Is it such a big deal to you?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Is what a big deal?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Having children.&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka gave a derisive, wry little smile; he glanced away, then looked back at her. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t been listening to me at all, have you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I <i>have</i> been listening,&#x201d; she said with a glare she hoped he&#x2019;d notice. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m asking.&#x201d;<br>The smile faded from his lips. He nodded slowly. &#x201c;It <i>is</i> a big deal. A very big deal. Essential, even. If we can&#x2019;t have children, there&#x2019;s no point to us being married. Romantic love between a man and a woman always fades with time. People live together in order to build a family. A man and woman get married and become husband and wife. Then they have children and become father and mother. Only then do they become life partners in the true sense of the word. You don&#x2019;t agree?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s all marriage is.&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka shook his head. &#x201c;I do. I believe it quite strongly and have no intention of changing my mind. Which is to say, I&#x2019;ve no intention of continuing on like this if we can&#x2019;t have children.&#x201d;<br>Ayane pressed her fingers to her temples. She had a headache. She hadn&#x2019;t seen this one coming. &#x201c;Let me get this straight,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a woman who can&#x2019;t bear your children. So you&#x2019;ll throw me out and switch to someone who can? That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re telling me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No need to put it so harshly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re saying!&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka straightened. He hesitated, frowning slightly, before nodding again. &#x201c;I suppose that from your perspective it would look that way, yes. You have to understand, I take my life plan very seriously. More seriously than anything else.&#x201d;<br>Ayane&#x2019;s lips curled upward, though smiling was the furthest thing from her mind. &#x201c;You like telling people that, don&#x2019;t you? How you take your life plan so seriously. It was one of the first things you said when we met.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you so upset about, Ayane? You have everything you ever wanted. If there&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve forgotten, just ask. I intend to do everything I can for you. So let&#x2019;s just stop all this fussing, and start thinking about the future. Unless you see some other way forward?&#x201d;<br>Ayane turned to face the wall. Her eyes fell on a meter-wide tapestry hanging there. It had taken her three months to make it; she remembered the material, special ordered direct from a manufacturer in England.<br>She didn&#x2019;t need Yoshitaka to tell her how important children were. She had wanted them herself, desperately. How many times had she dreamed of sitting in a rocking chair, stitching a patchwork quilt, watching her belly grow larger with each passing day? But God, in his mischief, had made that impossible. So she had given up&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t like she&#x2019;d had a choice&#x2014;and resigned herself to living without. She had thought her husband would be okay with that.<br>&#x201c;I know it might seem silly to you, but can I ask one question?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>Ayane faced him again, taking a deep breath. &#x201c;What about your love for me? Whatever happened to that?&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka flinched, then gradually his smile returned. &#x201c;My love for you hasn&#x2019;t changed a bit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can assure you of that. I <i>do</i> still love you.&#x201d;<br>That was a complete lie, as far as Ayane was concerned. But she smiled and said that was good. She wasn&#x2019;t sure how else to respond.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; Yoshitaka stood and headed for the door.<br>Ayane glanced at her dresser, thinking about the white powder hidden in a sealed plastic bag in the bottommost drawer on the right.<br><i>Guess I&#x2019;ll be using that soon,</i> she thought, the last glimmer of hope fading beneath the shadow inside her.<br>As she followed him out the door, she stared at Yoshitaka&#x2019;s back, thinking, <i>I love you more than anything else in this world. That&#x2019;s why your words were like a knife stabbing me in the heart.</i><br><i>That&#x2019;s why you have to die, too.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2008 by Keigo Higashino<br></p><h2>His Promised Land: The Autobiography of John P. Parker, Former Slave and Conductor on the Underground Railroad</h2><p><p><strong>"Surpasses all previous slave narratives...Usually we need to invent our American heroes. With the publication of Parker's extraordinary memoir, we seem to have discovered the genuine article." &#x2015;Joseph J. Ellis, <em>Civilization</em></strong></p><p>In the words of an African American conductor on the Underground Railroad, <em>His Promised Land</em> is the unusual and stirring account of how the war against slavery was fought&#x2015;and sometimes won. John P. Parker (1827&#x2015;1900) told this dramatic story to a newspaperman after the Civil War. He recounts his years of slavery, his harrowing runaway attempt, and how he finally bought his freedom. Eventually moving to Ripley, Ohio, a stronghold of the abolitionist movement, Parker became an integral part of the Underground Railroad, helping fugitive slaves cross the Ohio River from Kentucky and go north to freedom. Parker risked his life&#x2015;hiding in coffins, diving off a steamboat into the river with bounty hunters on his trail&#x2015;and his own freedom to fight for the freedom of his people.</p></p><p>John Parker was born a slave in Virginia but managed to buy his freedom. He hated the injustice of slavery, and so for about 20 years before the Civil War devoted his life to the dangerous work of helping other blacks escape to freedom. This is one of only a few accounts of a black American&#39;s fight against slavery in his own words. Unpublished for nearly a century, it brings to life the American frontier of the mid-18th century in as thrilling a fashion as any John Ford film or historical novel.<p><strong>John P. Parker</strong> (1827 &#x2013; 1900) was an American abolitionist, inventor, iron moulder and industrialist. He helped hundreds of slaves to freedom in the Underground Railroad based in Ripley, Ohio.</p><p><strong>Stuart Seely Sprague</strong> was a professor in history at Morehead State University from 1968 to 1995. His areas of concentration included Appalachian history and African American studies.</p></p><h2>MIGHTY THOR VOL. 2: LORDS OF MIDGARD</h2><p>The legend continues with Thors new and old!

That's why the Bible tells us, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind" (Romans 12:2a).

The authors provide models for cultivating a biblical mind-set on worship, psychology, gender, science, education, history, government, economics, and literature.

Sweeping aside the gossip, slander, and distortion that have shrouded the Borgias for centuries, G. J. Meyer offers an unprecedented portrait of the infamous Renaissance family and their storied milieu.</b><br> &nbsp;<br>They burst out of obscurity in Spain not only to capture the great prize of the papacy, but to do so twice. Throughout a tumultuous half-century&#x2014;as popes, statesmen, warriors, lovers, and breathtakingly ambitious political adventurers&#x2014;they held center stage in the glorious and blood-drenched pageant known to us as the Italian Renaissance, standing at the epicenter of the power games in which Europe&#x2019;s kings and Italy&#x2019;s warlords gambled for life-and-death stakes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five centuries after their fall&#x2014;a fall even more sudden than their rise to the heights of power&#x2014;they remain immutable symbols of the depths to which humanity can descend: Rodrigo Borgia, who bought the papal crown and prostituted the Roman Church; Cesare Borgia, who became first a teenage cardinal and then the most treacherous cutthroat of a violent time; Lucrezia Borgia, who was as shockingly immoral as she was beautiful. These have long been stock figures in the dark chronicle of European villainy, their name synonymous with unspeakable evil.<br> &nbsp;<br> But did these Borgias of legend actually exist? Grounding his narrative in exhaustive research and drawing from rarely examined key sources, Meyer brings fascinating new insight to the real people within the age-encrusted myth. Equally illuminating is the light he shines on the brilliant circles in which the Borgias moved and the thrilling era they helped to shape, a time of wars and political convulsions that reverberate to the present day, when Western civilization simultaneously wallowed in appalling brutality and soared to extraordinary heights. <br> &nbsp;<br> Stunning in scope, rich in telling detail, G. J.

Of &#x201c;apoplexy,&#x201d; the attending physicians have declared, thereby revealing that they haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea of what it was that caused him to grow feebler week after week until finally, aged only fifty-seven, he himself announced that his end was at hand.<br><br>The death of this particular pontiff at this particular time is a deeply worrisome thing. As for the fact that the time has come to elect his successor&#x2014;it is so snarled up in difficulties and dangers as to scarcely bear thinking about.<br><br>Officially and as usual, the first nine days after the pope&#x2019;s death were reserved for the obsequies with which deceased pontiffs are launched into the afterlife: one requiem mass per day, each presided over by a different cardinal. But in fact, and inevitably, the days and the nights as well have been filled with backstairs politicking, mainly to see who can put together the most potent blocs of votes. In the midst of all this, Nicholas&#x2019;s wizened little body has been sealed up in the traditional three coffins, one of cypress inside another of lead inside still another of fine-grained and polished elm. It was then laid to rest in the crypt under the basilica, a structure so alarmingly decrepit that in the last few years of the pope&#x2019;s reign 2,500 cartloads of stone had been stripped from the Colosseum and hauled across the Tiber for use in shoring it up.<br><br>By the time the last Ite, missa est brought the last mass to an end, the windows of one wing of the pontifical palace were boarded up in the customary way. Austere little cells, each containing a cot, a stool, and a small table, have been hammered together inside. The fifteen available cardinals (six others are too far from Rome to attend) are now reporting for duty. As they file inside, the doors are bolted behind them. Guards are posted, and the conclave of 1455 is formally in session.<br><br>Deprived of natural light, the cardinals are dependent on candles and oil lamps for illumination. With no ventilation and wood fires the only source of morning warmth, the air they breathe will soon be foul. But conclaves are not supposed to be pleasant. Physical discomfort long ago proved its value. It encourages the princes of the Church to get on with their business, announce the results, and go home.<br><br>Every part of the process is governed by customs that have evolved over a millennium and a half. At various times the choosing of popes has been under the control of Roman emperors, Byzantine emperors, and Holy Roman emperors from beyond the Alps. Sometimes popes have been able to nominate their successors, and there have been periods when no one would dare take the throne without the approval of the clergy&#x2014;even the people&#x2014;of Rome. But in 1059 a papal decree conferred the right of election on the College of Cardinals. Eighty years later another decree gave that right to the cardinals exclusively, meaning that no further approvals were needed once the Sacred College had made its choice. Forty years after that, a two-thirds majority of votes cast became necessary for election.<br><br>With that, the pattern was set. Though there have been other changes&#x2014;an attempt, for example, to force fast action by reducing the cardinals&#x2019; rations if they fail to reach a decision within three days and reducing them again if a pope has not been elected after five&#x2014;the essential rules could hardly be simpler. Whoever can get the votes of ten of the men now locked together inside the palace will assume the full powers of the papacy from the moment of his election. He will do so even if the whole outside world disapproves.<br><br>Simple rules are no assurance of an easy outcome, however. Choosing a pope is always a complicated affair, because much is always at stake and so many competing forces invariably come into play. Things rarely go smoothly. As the cardinals settle into their cubicles and begin to talk among themselves, they know that this election is unlikely to be an exception.<br><br>Not that Nicholas has left them with a mess. To the contrary, he was in no way a bad or even a careless pope. By the standards of the time he was a good one. Anyone comparing him with his immediate predecessors might find reason to call him an almost great one. Raised in humble circumstances in northwestern Italy, he had risen in the Church purely on the basis of merit&#x2014;first as one of the leading humanist scholars of his time, then through success as a diplomat. His election was a fluke; he became a cardinal only a few months before the conclave that made him pope, and it never could have happened if the most powerful factions in the College of Cardinals had not deadlocked. But the eight years of his reign proved to be rich in achievement and free of scandal. He contributed greatly to bringing peace and a measure of stability not only to Italy but to Germany as well, ended a last outbreak of schism, found honest ways to replenish the Vatican&#x2019;s treasury, and resumed the oft-interrupted process of trying to restore the decayed city of Rome to its lost splendor.<br><br>Even more remarkably, he appointed only a single relative, a half-brother to the College of Cardinals and did nothing to enrich his kin. All in all, his reign has been an impressive step forward in the rebuilding of the papacy&#x2014;in restoring its ancient importance and prestige. Whether this will continue or now come to a stop is likely to depend, everyone knows, on who is chosen to succeed him.<br><br>The problems facing the cardinals go much deeper than anything Nicholas did or failed to do. They are the residue of the century and a half of discord that preceded his reign: generation after generation of exile, of schism, of a deeply damaging struggle to decide whether the pope is the supreme head of the Church or subordinate to general councils. Some of the great questions are by now settled, or at least appear to be, but ugly memories are still fresh, deep wounds unhealed. Nicholas&#x2019;s election came only four years after the return of the last exiled pope to Rome, and it was not until two years after his election that the last antipope abandoned his claim to the throne. A mere two years separate Nicholas&#x2019;s death from the latest plot to overthrow papal rule and restore republican government in Rome. That he escaped unharmed does not mean that all danger has passed. That too is likely to depend, at least in part, on who takes his place.<br><br>If all Italy is at peace in 1455, this again is a departure from recent history and a fragile one. The peninsula last erupted in general war as recently as 1452, when Venice attacked Milan; Florence, Genoa, Bologna, and Mantua all came to Milan&#x2019;s assistance; and Naples threw in with Venice. The pope, to his credit, kept Rome neutral, thereby leaving himself free to help broker a settlement and bring the belligerents together in what he called the Italian or Most Holy League. This league is without precedent in Italian history, a defensive alliance encompassing the whole peninsula, obliging longtime enemies to embrace each other as friends and aimed at establishing a balance of power stable enough to preserve the peace. It became effective only weeks before Nicholas&#x2019;s death, when the troublesome king of Naples finally signed on, and was the crowning achievement of the pope&#x2019;s career. It is supposed to remain in effect for twenty-five years, but the realities of Italian political life make its chances of doing so vanishingly small. The part that Nicholas played in making it all happen, coupled with his departure from the stage, adds to the sense that the conclave now in session matters more than most.<br><br>The existence of the league requires the most powerful princes in Italy to pledge to do things that they are unaccustomed to doing: respect existing frontiers, join forces to punish any state that breaks the peace, and work together to keep foreign powers out. It obliges the most ruthless and ambitious of these princes to abandon&#x2014;to defer, anyway&#x2014;long-cherished dreams of subduing their neighbors and seizing their domains. Few of them would have agreed to any such thing if not for one of the supreme political catastrophes of the late Middle Ages: the capture by the Ottoman Turks, just twenty-three months before Nicholas&#x2019;s death, of the fabled city of Constantinople.<br><br>For eleven hundred years Constantinople had been the capital of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire, and incomparably richer and more important than Rome. It had also, for half a millennium, been the seat of the Orthodox Church. But after centuries of decline and generations of being dismantled piecemeal by the relentlessly expanding empire of the Turks, nothing remained but a pale shadow of what it had been at its zenith. Its end was tragic: after a siege of less than two months, a defense force of seven thousand troops was overwhelmed by eighty thousand Islamic invaders. This was followed by three days of horror, as Sultan Mehmed II (&#x201c;Mehmed the Conqueror,&#x201d; only twenty-one years old) rewarded his men by allowing them to pillage, rape, and kill at their pleasure. As many as fifty thousand of the proud old city&#x2019;s inhabi�tants were put to the sword, and the survivors disappeared into the slave markets of the East. It was a world-changing event, and it chilled the blood of every Christian who understood its significance.<br><br>The West had no right to be shocked, actually; its leaders could not claim to have been caught off guard. They had stood by passively through all the years when the Turks drew ever closer to Constantinople. The city&#x2019;s emperors had sent ever more desperate appeals for help, and Europe not only failed to respond but contributed to making collapse inevitable. If at midcentury the Turks controlled much of the Balkan peninsula and Hungary south of the Danube, this was not a new state of affairs: all of Bulgaria, along with much of Serbia, had been seized more than fifty years before. That Constantinople itself had become the Turks&#x2019; prime objective could not have been more obvious. When they cut off the Bosporus, the great waterway connecting Constantinople to the Black Sea and the world beyond, the city was caught in a stranglehold, its doom clearly imminent. Its last emperor&#x2014;whose name, rather sadly, was Constantine, and who would die fighting when the Turks came swarming over his walls&#x2014;got little from the West except bombastic words of encouragement and promises that meant nothing. Nicholas V made some effort to organize a rescue expedition, but nothing came of it. His failure to do more would be seen by many as the one disgrace of his reign.<br><br>In taking Constantinople the Turks gained not only a glorious new capital for their empire&#x2014;the Hagia Sophia, one of the architectural wonders of classical times, was converted from a church to a mosque&#x2014;not only one of the world&#x2019;s most magnificent harbors, but a platform from which to threaten central and southern Europe. Venice, its fabulous wealth dependent on access to eastern markets, is the most threatened of the Italian states, but this too has long been the case, and Venice has been slow to take alarm. Its merchant princes grew up thinking of Constantinople as their principal commercial rival, not as a bulwark against Muslim aggression, and they took foolish satisfaction in its decline. They nursed hopes of taming the Turks and turning them into business partners. The folly of such thinking was not exposed until the Turks sank a Venetian ship trying to pass through the Bosporus, beheaded all the crewmen who had not drowned, and put the body of its captain on display after killing him by impalement. But by then, at least where Constantinople was concerned, it was already too late.<br><br>That Venice is not alone in its peril became clear when Sultan Mehmed, after taking Constantinople, added &#x201c;Roman Caesar&#x201d; to his list of titles. No one has mistaken this for a joke; if Constantinople could fall, so could Rome. And if Rome fell, who could say that Christian civilization was not doomed? It is questions like this, and the grimness of the only credible answers, that have caused the leading Italian powers to put aside their quarrels and come together in the Holy League.<br><br>These are the issues that hang over Italy, the Church, and Europe in April 1455, creating an urgent need for leadership. Human nature being what it is, however, they are not necessarily the issues that matter most to the cardinals sequestered in the Vatican. Domestic rivalries loom larger, and some at least of the cardinals can be depended upon to care more about getting an advantage over their rivals, or stopping their rivals from getting an advantage over them, than about anything as abstract as the fate of Western civilization. Coiled like a serpent at the heart of the conclave, capable of poisoning everything, is the blood feud that almost from time immemorial has kept Rome&#x2019;s two greatest families at each other&#x2019;s throats. Without the hatred of the Orsini for the Colonna and the Colonna for the Orsini, the seven Italians who make up the conclave&#x2019;s largest national contingent could expect to have little difficulty recruiting the three additional votes needed to deliver the papacy to one of their own. Because of that hatred, the election of an Italian is going to be difficult at best.<br><br>This is no trivial matter. Since the return of the papal court from what is called the Babylonian Captivity, when for sixty-seven years it remained at Avignon in Provence and so completely under the thumb of the kings of France that seven consecutive popes were Frenchmen, there has been a return also to the assumption that popes should be Roman, and if not Roman then at least Italian. The people of the Eternal City take this idea seriously indeed. The cardinals know that the election of an outsider is likely to bring angry crowds into the streets, and that the election of someone from what the Romans regard as the barbarian world beyond the Alps would be certain to do so. Though the city has been fairly tranquil since the failure of the republican conspiracy of 1453, thanks largely to the pains taken by Nicholas V to deal even-handedly with the ever-jealous Orsini and Colonna and other baronial clans, not a great deal is ever needed to spark an explosion in Rome. The separation of the Italian cardinals into irreconcilable camps, and the consequent possibility of a non-Italian pope, are further causes of anxiety.<br><br>The Italians cannot be unified because of the presence of two of the Sacred College&#x2019;s most formidable members, both of them Roman nobles, both in their mid-forties, and both able to draw on enormous reserves of political, financial, and even military power. Latino Orsini occupies the seat in the college that his family has held for so many centuries that its leaders regard it as theirs by right, as practically their personal property. Among the ornaments on his family tree are three Orsini popes, the first elected in 1191, and the second so notorious for corruption that Dante gave him a small speaking role as one of the damned souls in The Inferno. Latino need look no further than to his clan&#x2019;s history for lessons in what a boon it can be to put a relative, or someone dependent on one&#x2019;s relatives, on the papal throne. And for equally compel...</p><h2>Al Sieber: Chief of Scouts</h2><p>General George Crook planned and organized the principal Apache campaign in Arizona, and General Nelson Miles took credit for its successful conclusion on the 1800s, but the men who really won it were rugged frontiersmen such as Al Sieber, the renowned Chief of Scouts. Crook relied on Sieber to lead Apache scouts against renegade Apaches, who were adept at hiding and raiding from within their native terrain. In this carefully researched biography, Dan L. Thrapp gives extensive evidence for Sieber&#x2019;s expertise, noting that the expeditions he accompanied were highly successful whereas those from which he was absent met with few triumphs. Perhaps the greatest tribute to his abilities was paid by a San Carlos Apache who, no matter how miserable life might become, because, he said, Sieber would find him even if he left no tracks.</p><p><b>Dan Thrapp, </b>who was a graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism, was a foreign correspondent for the United Press in Argentina, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom and, for a number of years, an editor for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

By the year 1810, only forty years later, the tribal territories in all but the most northerly reaches of the San Francisco Bay region were empty. The change began when Spanish colonial explorers passed through the region in the year 1769. Soon after, in 1776 and 1777, the Spanish invaders founded the missions of San Francisco de Asis and Santa Clara, respectively.<br><br>"Over the succeeding decades people from one local tribe after another left their villages and moved to the missions. The story of tribal disintegration in the Bay Area is a complex one. No two tribal groups were confronted by the choice to join the missions under exactly the same set of circumstances. There was, however, a common experiential thread over the forty years; each tribe left its homeland for the missions when a significant portion of its members came to believe that the move was the only reasonable alternative in a transformed world. They were not marched to the baptismal font by soldiers with guns (cf. Cook 1943:74).<br><br>"Although many tribal people came to view themselves as culturally inferior, not every tribal person was impressed by the Spanish invaders.... Most people held mixed feelings of hatred and admiration toward the missions. They struggled with those feelings in a terrible, internally destructive attempt to cope with changes that were beyond their control. Eventually even those people who clearly rejected the values of mission life capitulated, because of changes in their tribal lands, disease, depopulation, and the accompanying collapse of intergroup alliances....<br><br>"This book is about the independent nations that once lived in the Bay Area and their reaction to the Spanish influence. It is not a study of the Spaniards, or of their motives and plans as agents of western expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area. Spanish behaviors are discussed insofar as they redefined the universe of the native peoples and limited their options for action. Spanish military power thwarted every tribal attempt to drive the Spaniards out or to negotiate with them as equals. So native groups had little to say about the shape of the new order, the location of alien settlements, the distribution of new tools, techniques, and foodstuffs, or the appropriate integration of new customs and religious practices.<br><br>"Day in and day out, throughout the mission era, ambivalent native villagers along the mission-tribal frontier struggled with a choice find a place in the new mission system, or resist its attractions. The decision to reject mission life could be made a thousand times, but the decision to join a mission could be made only once."</p><p></p><h2>Magical Girl Site Vol. 2</h2><p><p><b>WHY NOT GIVE IT A TRY?

His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It s a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie s five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his meaningless life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: Why was I here?<br><br>A moving and profound contemporary fable, <b>The Five People You Meet in Heaven </b>is an important reminder of the interconnectedness of us all.</p><p>Part melodrama and part parable, Mitch Albom's <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i> weaves together three stories, all told about the same man: 83-year-old Eddie, the head maintenance person at Ruby Point Amusement Park. As the novel opens, readers are told that Eddie, unsuspecting, is only minutes away from death as he goes about his typical business at the park. Albom then traces Eddie's world through his tragic final moments, his funeral, and the ensuing days as friends clean out his apartment and adjust to life without him. In alternating sections, Albom flashes back to Eddie's birthdays, telling his life story as a kind of progress report over candles and cake each year. And in the third and last thread of the novel, Albom follows Eddie into heaven where the maintenance man sequentially encounters five pivotal figures from his life (a la <i>A Christmas Carol</i>). Each person has been waiting for him in heaven, and, as Albom reveals, each life (and death) was woven into Eddie's own in ways he never suspected. Each soul has a story to tell, a secret to reveal, and a lesson to share. Through them Eddie understands the meaning of his own life even as his arrival brings closure to theirs. <p> Albom takes a big risk with the novel; such a story can easily veer into the saccharine and preachy, and this one does in moments. But, for the most part, Albom's telling remains poignant and is occasionally profound.

New York City had, in battle after battle, been ingloriously lost. Even the outpost named for Lee himself&#x2014;New Jersey&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fort Lee&#x201d;&#x2014;had been abandoned. Philadelphia seemed next. Thousands of rebel soldiers had been lost, either slain in battle or now bound in heavy iron chains. Thousands more had simply vanished and gone home.<br> <br>It was mid-morning, nearing ten o&#x2019;clock, yet General Lee sat quietly in his soiled, rumpled cap and dressing gown, here at the widow Mary White&#x2019;s two-storied, two-chimneyed tavern in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. The slovenly Lee cheerfully munched upon his eggs and hard bread and plentiful portions of bacon and ham, occasionally pausing to fling a scrap or two of what had recently been ambulatory swine to the ravenous pack of faithful hounds who seemingly accompanied this strange man wherever he traveled. Between munches and flings, Lee took quill pen in hand to inscribe a letter to General Horatio Gates furiously raging against their mutual superior, George Washington. &#x201c;A certain man,&#x201d; Lee scribbled hurriedly, &#x201c;is damnably deficient.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lee wrote rapidly for a very good reason: All hell was breaking loose. To enjoy this breakfast (and perhaps more of the company of the tavern&#x2019;s comely ladies), Lee had foolishly separated himself from his troops&#x2014;troops he had long delayed bringing southward from New York state to reinforce Washington&#x2019;s woefully depleted forces. Troops that were now busily heading for a semblance of safety across the ice-choked Delaware River in Pennsylvania. Only a handful of guards had accompanied Lee and his aide to the widow White&#x2019;s tavern.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re surrounded, you traitor, Lee!&#x201d; came a shout from outside. &#x201c;Surrender or forfeit your worthless life!&#x201d; The startled Lee finished writing his last sentence, breaking his quill point as he did, and sprang from his seat. Falling to his knees, he peered out from the bottom of a nearby sill to view a squad of green-jacketed British dragoons, their muskets at the ready.<br> <br>Lee could not be sure which one had shouted, but that was the least of his problems.<br> <br>It was, in fact, twenty-two-year-old Cornet Banastre Tarleton, among the most capable and vicious men fighting under the Union Jack. Lee bolted from his table and scurried for safety just as the hard-faced Tarleton&#x2019;s men unleashed a cascade of fire. Smoke and deafening thunder&#x2014;and lead shot&#x2014;filled the air. Several of Lee&#x2019;s guards fell dead or wounded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hide here!&#x201d; screamed a barmaid. &#x201c;Hide in my bed!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d die first!&#x201d; shouted Lee, as his hounds growled and barked and ran about the house in panic. &#x201c;I will fight to the last!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll burn the house down! To the ground!&#x201d; shouted Tarleton. &#x201c;You have five minutes to surrender!&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles Lee&#x2019;s last came very soon. But it ended with neither death nor victory. Now attired in his old blue coat and battered cock hat, his breeches spattered with grease, he merely shuffled out the tavern&#x2019;s front door. His captors hustled him upon a horse and sounded a bugle as Charles Lee was led away to a British camp at Brunswick.<br> <br>December 1776<br>Trenton, New Jersey<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Colonel Johann Gottlieb Rall questioned. The gruff, fifty-year-old &#x201c;Hessian Lion&#x201d; spoke no English. He spoke only war&#x2014;and contempt for his Amerikanischen adversaries. Before him, he saw a body carried forward. Another Hessian soldier hobbled past him, assisted by two more grenadiers, blood still seeping freely from the bandages wrapped tightly just above his left knee.<br> <br>&#x201c;Another ambush, Colonel Rall. Corporal Schmidt killed. Shot straight through the heart. Private Keller wounded,&#x201d; answered Lieutenant Andreas von Wiederholdt, who had recently begun to appear much older than his forty-four years. His soldiers could not venture a step outside this miserable village of Trenton without being fired upon by these rebel madmen. Even being within its limits offered little safety. A shot from the woods&#x2014;blam!&#x2014;might be fired into the back of an unsuspecting sentry patrolling Trenton&#x2019;s outskirts. And what could anyone hope to do about it?<br> <br>Wiederholdt and his men could no longer rest decently at night. They remained on constant alert, fitfully sleeping in their blue-and-black uniforms, ready to spring into action at a moment&#x2019;s notice and confront a patriot&#x2019;s musket. The darkening bags under Wiederholdt&#x2019;s eyes and the disheveled nature of his own once invariably neat, brass-buttoned uniform revealed that.<br> <br>A column of men appeared on the horizon, on the road leading northward out of the town, but they were too far away to clearly identify. Was it the Americans? Daring to attack us directly? Wiederholdt&#x2019;s bony face froze in fear. But now he noticed something&#x2014;shafts of reflected sunlight danced about the head of each figure advancing toward him, emanating from the tall, pointed, polished brass helmet that each Hessian grenadier so proudly wore. It was, Wiederholdt now saw, merely Lieutenant Jakob Piel&#x2019;s company trudging home from a fourteen-mile march to the British outpost at Princeton. A small, very relieved smile played across his thin lips.<br> <br>Rall could not but help notice Wiederholdt&#x2019;s cascading emotions. &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; he joked to his subordinate. &#x201c;You see Americans everywhere! Are you a soldier or an old woman?&#x201d;<br> <br>Wiederholdt silently accepted the insult. Who is Rall bluffing? he thought. He knows what&#x2019;s going on; that it&#x2019;s unsafe for messengers&#x2014;or anyone&#x2014;out there. These Americans hate us. They see us as invaders&#x2014;oppressors. That&#x2019;s why we have to send a hundred troops to guard a single messenger to Princeton!<br> <br>But Wiederholdt was not about to maintain his silence about everything. &#x201c;Colonel Rall,&#x201d; he said deferentially, hoping not to agitate his commandant too much, &#x201c;perhaps we should now move to fortify Trenton. I know Colonel von Donop has recommended erecting redoubts on both the upper end of town and along the river.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Donop!&#x201d; snapped Rall. &#x201c;Dummkopf! Let the Americans come! So much the better! If they dare to come we will have at them with our bayonets&#x2014;and that will be the end of George Washington!&#x201d;<br> <br>December 1776<br>(George Washington&#x2019;s headquarters)<br>Outside the farmhouse of Robert Merrick<br>Ten miles north of Trenton Falls<br>Bucks County, Pennsylvania<br> <br>Perhaps it would be the end of George Washington&#x2014;and of his revolution.<br> <br>Colonel Rall certainly thought Washington was on the ropes.<br> <br>General Lee had thought so as well.<br> <br>And so, though he hated to admit it, did Thomas Paine.<br> <br>It was no comfortable Philadelphia print shop in which Paine now sat. Patriotism meant more than words to the English-born pamphleteer. At forty, he now wore the short brown jacket and feathered hat of his unit of the Philadelphia Associators militia, &#x201c;The Flying Camp.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since August, Washington had done nothing but retreat. But while so many others had fled (only two days earlier he had been among those ordered to evacuate Fort Lee), Paine had remained and now, by flickering campfire light, employing the taut calfskin of a Continental Army drumhead as his desk, he scratched out the words of a new pamphlet. Hard circumstances demanded hard truths. Events mandated a call to action worthy of a sounding trumpet.<br> <br>Normally, Tom Paine wrote slowly and painfully&#x2014;but that was a luxury he could no longer afford. He paused&#x2014;but only for his smallish hand to dip a sharpened quill once more into the blackness of his pewter inkpot. His piercing blue eyes ablaze, he rapidly composed word after word in the fine penmanship he had learned as a boy in England. Before long he&#x2019;d completed his task.<br> <br>&#x201c;My good man! Come here!&#x201d; Paine demanded of an army courier, a rough-hewn frontiersman from the Pennsylvania backwoods who was mounted atop a horse that looked like it had served with its rider in the French and Indian War. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Thomas Paine. I hear you are bound for Philadelphia, to the Continental Congress.&#x201d;<br> <br>The courier stared blankly at Paine, who seemed a tad too excited for his tastes. He said nothing, but his horse flicked its tail&#x2014;more out of habit than anything else. It was now too cold for flies&#x2014;or any other sort of insect.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, man? What is it?&#x201d; Paine demanded, drawing out each syllable so this dimwit before him might better understand his simple question.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; came the answer in a harsh Scotch-Irish brogue, &#x201c;Philadelphia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean to ride with you, soldier. I need to return to my print shop. To have something printed of importance to our cause. How fast can you ride?&#x201d;<br> <br>The messenger eyed Paine with contempt. &#x201c;Fast enough for General Washington, sir,&#x201d; he answered. He was clearly annoyed by this Paine fellow, whoever he was.<br> <br>But Tom Paine didn&#x2019;t care whom he offended. He wanted his words printed&#x2014;while there was still an army to read them to.<br> <br>December 1776<br>Merrick farmhouse<br> <br>&#x201c;Any word yet from General Gates?&#x201d; General Washington asked.<br> <br>Washington had entreated Horatio Gates to join his forces, but Gates pled that he was simply too ill to travel. Like Charles Lee, he seemed strangely reluctant to meet with his commander&#x2014;or to follow simple orders.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, General,&#x201d; came a voice from the back of the room. It belonged to another general. &#x201c;But, enough of Gates. We have plenty of business before us, and I must repeat what I said yesterday: we must retreat to Philadelphia to safeguard our capital and our Congress. The very existence of our government is at stake. And besides that, we have suffered the capture of so many&#x2014;not to mention the thousands more whose enlistments have expired and have simply gone home. Two thousand from Maryland and New Jersey alone! And who knows how many more have simply deserted our cause? We must safeguard Philadelphia at all costs.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence filled the room, which was crowded with the Continental Army&#x2019;s senior staff.<br> <br>George Washington was often slow to speak. Now, in this very crucial moment, he again paused before answering. Was he simply composing his thoughts? About to agree, or disagree with this unpalatable proposition? Or was he waiting, as he often did, for as many officers who so wanted to speak freely?<br> <br>No one said a word.<br> <br>Nathanael Greene might have been one to speak up, but his recent counsel to hold Fort Washington in upper Manhattan had proven so disastrous that he hesitated to offer any advice at that moment. It would take a while for the marvelously capable Rhode Islander to regain his confidence, so on this morning Greene merely shifted his feet and kept his gaze downward.<br> <br>A young artillery officer, Alexander Hamilton, as slight and delicate as a fifteen-year-old regimental fifer, but as hardened as any grizzled veteran of Fort Necessity, stood, arms folded, his back stiffening in barely controlled rage. But it was not for twenty-two-year-old captains to publicly upbraid generals. So he, too, kept his silence.<br> <br>The normally jovial Henry Knox&#x2019;s puffy eyes narrowed in anger. If Knox could have marshaled his 280-pound frame to crush this defeatist, he would have gladly done so right then and there. But, as even his many friends would have conceded, General Knox&#x2019;s ample body contained nary an ounce of actual muscle. Nay, if Henry Knox were to dispatch him, it would have to be by sitting upon the old faker and suffocating him.<br> <br>Knox gave the idea of retreating to Philadelphia some thought. He was about to set off his booming voice when Washington instead began to speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;General,&#x201d; Washington said, his tone measured but firm, his words addressed to his questioner, &#x201c;our soldiers take their leave because we retreat. Men enlist for victory, not humiliation. We must, even in this hour of peril&#x2014;no, particularly in this hour of gravest peril&#x2014;provide our men with the taste of victory to feed their hungry souls. And I speak not merely about the men under arms but of an entire continent of patriots.<br> <br>&#x201c;The enemy has spread his forces thin. They should be pursuing us&#x2014;building boats and bridges and moving to crush us in our weakness. But, no, instead they rest. We must not rest. We must strike. We have the boats to move back victoriously across the Delaware, just as we once ingloriously fled the other way.<br> <br>&#x201c;We must strike! Now!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, General,&#x201d; came the response of yet another general, another senior officer skilled in the art of disguising inaction in the more fashionable garments of logic and reason. &#x201c;But where would we strike? How? When? Against what units of the enemy? And what do we really know of their encampments and habits? Grand strategies must be grounded in hard intelligence&#x2014;or they are no procession toward triumphal monuments and arches, but rather to our gravestones.&#x201d;<br> <br>Washington began to ponder that point, when suddenly a hard rapping noise at the door broke the silence. A guard announced that a visitor was demanding to see General Washington at once. He could not wait, he said&#x2014;and he had to see the general alone.<br> <br>It was all highly irregular, of course, but something told Washington that he should indeed confer with this mysterious visitor.<br> <br>He abruptly broke off his council of war, letting his critics, all puffed up with fine excuses for retreat, own the last word. When all had departed, Washington sat alone, awaiting this stranger and whatever it was that he might have to convey.<br> <br>A man, rough-hewn but stout, gingerly dared to enter.<br> <br>&#x201c;You demand my time,&#x201d; Washington instantly challenged him, catching him off guard. &#x201c;State your name and purpose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I, sir, am John Honeyman,&#x201d; the man answered in the burr of his native Scotland. &#x201c;I am a farmer from near to Trenton, and I sell my vegetables to the Hessians stationed in the town. They pay good money&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We pay in continental scrip, if you are here to peddle us your wares,&#x201d; Washington cut him off.<br> <br>&#x201c;They pay good money,&#x201d; Honeyman continued, &#x201c;but they work for our British oppressors, and I hate them. Neither gold guineas nor Spanish dollars can buy my love for them!&#x201d;<br> <br>The glint in Washington&#x2019;s eyes conveyed the pleasure he felt in those words, a secret satisfaction his ever-guarded lips dared not betray.<br> <br>Honeyman now reached his point.<br> <br>&#x201c;I sell my wares. I take my oxcart to Trenton. I see everything&#x2014;and I remember everything, sir. I can draw you a fine map. I can tell you where each man is stationed. The very position of each cannon. The hour at which their guards are changed&#x2014;that there are no fortifications. I can even tell you when their Colonel Rall arises. He is quite the late riser, you know&#x2014;or you may not know that. Such is what I have to sell to you today, General Washington.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Honeyman,&#x201d; Washington replied, as he extended a chair to this burly gift from the gods of war and fortune, &#x201c;please, take a seat.

They were the mothers who powerfully shaped their sons&#x2019;visions of domestic life, from hot-tempered Mary Ball Washington to promiscuous Rachel Lavien, Hamilton&#x2019;s mother. Lovers and wives played even more critical roles. We learn of the youthful Washington&#x2019;s tortured love for the coquettish Sarah Fairfax, a close friend&#x2019;s wife; of Franklin&#x2019;s two &#x201c;wives,&#x201d; one in London and one in Philadelphia; of how lonely, deeply unhappy Abigail kept home and family togetherfor years on end during Adams&#x2019;s long absences; of Hamilton&#x2019;s adulterous betrayal of his wife and their eventual reconciliation; of how the brilliant Madison, jilted by a flirtatious fifteen-year-old, went on to marry the effervescent Dolley, who helped make this shy man into a popular president. Jefferson&#x2019;s controversial relationshipwith Sally Hemings is also examined, reinterpreting where his heart truly lay.</p><p>Thomas Fleming is the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, most recently, <em>The Perils of Peace</em>.

One of the most notable impacts of these shifts is the emergence of highly complex and elaborate forms of serial narrative, resulting in a robust period of formal experimentation and risky programming rarely seen in a medium that is typically viewed as formulaic and convention bound.&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Complex TV&nbsp;offers a sustained analysis of the poetics of television narrative, focusing on how storytelling has changed in recent years and how viewers make sense of these innovations. Through close analyses of key programs, including&nbsp;<em>The Wire, Lost, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Veronica Mars, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Mad Men</em>&nbsp;the book traces the emergence of this narrative mode, focusing on issues such as viewer comprehension, transmedia storytelling, serial authorship, character change, and cultural evaluation.

This rupture violated the universalism that had been the essence of French republican theory since the late eighteenth century. Shepard contends that because the amputation of Algeria from the French body politic was accomplished illegally and without explanation, its repercussions are responsible for many of the racial and religious tensions that confront France today. </p><p>In portraying decolonization as an essential step in the inexorable "tide of history," the French state absolved itself of responsibility for the revolutionary change it was effecting. It thereby turned its back not only on the French of Algeria&#x2015;Muslims in particular&#x2015;but also on its own republican principles and the 1958 Constitution. From that point onward, debates over assimilation, identity, and citizenship&#x2015;once focused on the Algerian "province/colony"&#x2015;have troubled France itself. In addition to grappling with questions of race, citizenship, national identity, state institutions, and political debate, Shepard also addresses debates in Jewish history, gender history, and queer theory.</p></p><p>"The need for historically specific accounts of decolonization has arguably never been more urgent. <i>The Invention of Decolonization</i> illuminates how `the end of French Algeria' reconfigured the social, sexual, and political orders of postwar France. Todd Shepard thereby joins the story of the Algerian War and its aftermath not just to histories of postcolonialism, but as provocatively to contemporary debates about national belonging, racialized citizenship, confessional politics, and state-sponsored efforts at remembrance, repatriation, and reconciliation."--Antoinette Burton, Professor of History and Bastian Professor of Global and Transnational Studies, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign <p> "Todd Shepard's examination of the way representations of Judaism, sexual orientation, and gender figured into political debates about decolonization is pathbreaking. Shepard makes a compelling analysis of how the war in Algeria and efforts to resolve the issues it raised were crucial to the making of the Fifth Republic. His excellent book is exemplary of new developments in conceiving and writing the history of France and Algeria."--Donald M. Reid, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill </p><p> "Todd Shepard's powerful book shows both how the decolonization of Algeria became thinkable in metropolitan France and why the French failed to come to terms with the contradictions inherent to the republican project, as they simultaneously distanced themselves from responsibility for the war. Shepard convincingly reveals the war's crucial role in recasting definitions of French identity and citizenship, which continue to shape current debates about racial inequality, exclusion, assimilation, immigration, and the place of Islam in France."--Caroline Ford, University of California, Los Angeles </p><p> "Todd Shepard, in this highly original and well-researched account, uncovers how France, attempting to hold together its empire after World War II, tried to become more inclusive--extending citizenship rights and a form of affirmative action to Muslim Algerians, only to reverse itself after losing Algeria in 1962. Abolishing by fiat Muslims' citizenship rights, now acting as if `colony' and `metropole' were necessarily starkly separated, France redefined itself as a singular nation in a more unambiguous and more exclusionary manner than had been the case before."--Frederick Cooper, New York University, author of <i>Colonialism in Question: Theory, Knowledge, History</i> </p><p> "The Algerian War has attracted huge attention in France during the last ten years. Most historians, however, have assumed that their task is simply to describe the workings of an apparently unstoppable process and they have, to a large extent, concentrated on the behavior of the French army. Todd Shepard's book approaches this debate from a new angle. Partly by looking through a wide lens--one that encompasses everything from Brigitte Bardot to Gaston Monnerville--and partly by taking the arguments in defense of Alg�rie Fran�aise seriously, he shows how departure from Algeria helped to create a new idea of Frenchnesss. This is an important book with implications for the current state of France as well as for many aspects of French history between 1830 and 1962."--Richard Vinen, King's College, London</p>Todd Shepard is Associate Professor of History at Temple University.</p><h2>The Up South Cookbook: Chasing Dixie in a Brooklyn Kitchen</h2><p><p><strong>Southern cooking meets the Brooklyn foodie scene, keeping charm (and grits) intact</strong></p><p>Georgia native Nicole Taylor spent her early twenties trying to distance herself from her southern cooking roots--a move "up" to Brooklyn gave her a fresh appreciation for the bread and biscuits, Classic Fried Chicken, Lemon Coconut Stack Cake, and other flavors of her childhood.</p><p><em>The Up South Cookbook</em> is a bridge to the past and a door to the future.

Vancouver in the clean, crisp summer of 1945 was full of wonder to this prospector's son from a remote village on the Arctic coast of Alaska. The reason for this happy visit was the end of the war in Europe and the return of his father by troopship that day.<br><br>Amid whirling bunting and the cheering of proud relatives, the veterans clambered off the Canadian Pacific steam train, some to renew their previous lives and loves, many to face the bitter realization of unattainable dreams or unexpected betrayals.<br><br>Daniel did not notice that his father was thin and gaunt, for he was still a great bear of a man and he bore gift-wrapped parcels of exciting shapes.<br><br>A taxicab took the family to their cheap lodgings close to Lion's Gate bridge. After tea and once the first waves of excitement were spent, Father made his long-planned pronouncement.<br><br>"We have six days before the steamer takes us home, my hidjies." Nobody knew why he called them that-only that it had a good, warm meaning. "And we will never forget these days, because the Hun are smashed forever and we are together."<br><br>The deep, flaky bilberry pie did the rounds again and everyone slept well despite their excitement, all six to the single bedroom.<br><br>The days flickered by in a kaleidoscope of happiness. They watched folk skiing on the lower slopes of Mount Grouse, on long planks of wood that looked impossible to control. Many skiers came to grief and Dan and his family laughed till the tears came.<br><br>They took a horse and cab to the wharves, bought toffee apples and walked hand in hand to watch the tradesmen at the sugar factory, and the trawlers with their brawny crews. Thousands more soldiers and sailors returned on giant troopships and the family joined the welcoming crowds. They saw the zoo and a pantomime, gazed at the sleaze of Gas Town and sang with gusto on the Sunday, for Mother and Father were keen Presbyterians, he with his Dutch Reform Church upbringing and she with a background of Wyoming and pioneer stock.<br><br>The Sunday before they were to take the steamer north, Father sprang his big surprise . . . There was a traveling circus in town and, dammit, they would check it out that very night.<br><br>Before the great event they squeezed into a packed church and joined in the songs of praise and the prayers of thanksgiving of the Vancouver people for the deliverance of their loved ones.<br><br>Then to the circus.<br><br>Clowns, elephants that could count, a giraffe, bears in kilts, dwarves, a sasquatch monster from the forests of the Rocky Mountain Trench, black fuzzy men, balloon shoots for prizes, and coconuts from the South Pacific propped on posts.<br><br>Even at five, brought up among Eskimo children, Daniel could throw the wooden ball straight and true. And he could shoot a light gun with fair accuracy providing he could take his time. He glowed with pride at his armful of coconuts and wooden teddies.<br><br>They cried with delight inside the sparkling waterways of the Canal of Love; they oohed and aahed with delicious horror in the House of Screams as ghouls of sacking and animal bones swished by on unseen pulleys.<br><br>Everyone but seven-year-old Naomi, who hated heights, was awed when Father pointed to the monstrous Roller-Wheel with its eighteen swinging gondolas. Daniel sat on his narrow seat, filled with curiosity and sticky-lipped with candy floss. An Indian and a grinning Chinaman, both in top hats, checked that the family were all strapped in. Because he was so little he was jammed in beside eleven-year-old Ruth, his eldest sister. In front of him sat Naomi, his mother's hands clenched about her and, at the prow of the gaily painted craft, just behind the carved redskin figurehead with its fearsome features, sat their father, beaming with pride and forever glancing over his shoulder to check that his brood were "having the finest time of their lives," especially his dear wife, to whom he had sworn that very morning, as he held her close, that he would never, never leave her again . . . not for the Commonwealth nor yet for the King himself.<br><br>As other families took their seats, the great twinkling wheel rotated in fits and starts until all the gondolas were filled with laughing, or gaping, passengers.<br><br>Then a whistle blew, the Chinaman waved a flag and two gates of steel clanged shut below them. Daniel smelled hot oil and roasted chestnuts. The cool air lifted Naomi's golden hair. Dad shouted, "Hold on, my love. Hold tight, my little darlings . . . try to kiss the stars."<br><br>The wheel spun ever faster and Daniel loved the speed, the height, the newness of it all. Only when Naomi screamed did the intense wonder that he felt begin to fade. And as his other sisters started to moan, even big Ruth, he knew that he too should be sensing fear. But he felt only more aware, more able to observe and consider. The giddy, lurching passage of the gondola was not as before. Something had changed. They were out of kilter with the mother wheel. He saw sparks in growing streams and a broken spar. Their cockleshell had come away from its housing on one side and as they swung over the top of the great arc and began the downward rush, so the remaining hinge-spar split and they were free, cartwheeling through space.<br><br>Nobody heard their screaming as they fell, for the carousels and the brass bands, the loudspeakers and sideshow criers produced a cacophony of sound that would have drowned out the knell of doom. And nobody saw the lace bonnet of young Anna, who clung by herself to the rearmost seat, glide and dip away like a falling kite.<br><br>The gondola crashed through the canvas of a small marquee. Ruth's body and the whim of chance saved Daniel's life. He was thrown against a pile of clothing. The wind was knocked out of him and his legs were broken but he remained fully conscious.<br><br>He saw the wrecked and green-painted prow, the head of a warrior, deeply impaled in the bowels of a fat Gypsy lady. He saw that his mother and Naomi had landed, tightly embracing, on the Gypsy's table. Their heads had come together with such force that the gray hair and the golden hair seemed to sprout from a single pulp. They were mercifully still but for their stockinged legs, which jerked in time with the billowing canvas of the ruined tent. Of sister Anna he could see no trace: perhaps an angel had caught her in the air and she was saved, as he was. He could feel no pain, only a desperate need to gulp for more air.<br><br>He thought he heard his name whispered aloud. Father was staring down at him, attached by one arm to the shattered upper end of the main tent pole. But now he was foreshortened, like the circus dwarves, for his torso had been severed at the waist. Daniel could see this all so clearly, for his father's remains were close above him and the mouth, agape beneath the thick moustache, did indeed seem to pout with the shape of Daniel's name.<br><br>From that moment until the present day, whenever de Villiers felt the images of that night hover at the fringes of his mind, he clenched his fists and forced them away.<br><br>With the passage of years, the warmer human emotions, with which he had been genetically blessed, remained in place on the far side of his self-imposed shutter. By excluding his sensitivities, de Villiers had retained his sanity. He was, but for his chosen profession as a contract killer, a pleasant enough human being . . .<br><br>2<br><br>Dhofar is the southern province of Oman, sharing desert borders with Saudi Arabia and South Yemen. In the 1960s a band of Dhofari nationalists, aiming to rid their country of an oppressive Omani sultan, visited the USSR in search of support. Their nationalist and Muslim aspirations were soon redirected by the Soviets into a new guerrilla unit called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman (PFLO). The unit's Marxist fighters, operating on their own home ground, were frighteningly efficient and for a while invincible. Fortunately, in 1970, Qaboos bin Said exiled his reactionary father, became the new sultan and proclaimed an amnesty. Many terrorists responded and were formed into armed firqat groups to fight against their former comrades, often from the same tribe or family.<br><br>Amr bin Issa, Sheikh of the Bait Jarboat tribe in Dhofar, was not a happy man. At forty-seven he was envied by many of his fellow jebalis, mountain tribesmen, for he was rich-richer than most jebalis could imagine.<br><br>As a seventeen-year-old Amr had left home with an uncle and sailed the Gulf waters in sardine dhows. For a while he worked as a gardener in Bahrain and as a delivery courier around town using a Lambretta moped. He had a keen eye for business and took advantage of the newfound wealth of the United Arab Emirates to set up a grocery and hardware shop in Dubai. A retail chain of Woolworth's lookalikes then evolved, second only to Khimji Ramdas in size and profitability.<br><br>Amr had married young, for he had a strong sexual appetite. His first wife was a great disappointment to him. She was an orphan girl who, like the majority of Dhofari women, had been brutally circumcised soon after birth. Her clitoris had been removed and, with it, most of her sensuality. Two sons were born who remained with their mother when Amr divorced her and went abroad. She remarried a man from the Bait Antaash and Amr rarely saw the two boys. Nonetheless they remained the blood of his blood.<br><br>His second marriage was altogether different. At the age of twenty- four he stopped off at an island on a fishing voyage and fell in love with a fourteen-year-old Shahra girl, Shamsa. Even before he discovered that her sexuality was intact he had determined to marry her, for to him she seemed the most alluring creature on earth.<br><br>The Shahra ranked low in the strict tribal hierarchy of Dhofar. Once the most powerful tribe in the land, they had borne the brunt of a century's fighting against Portuguese invaders. Greatly weakened, the Shahra gradually became subjugated to the Qara tribes until they were "nontribe," losing the right to carry weapons and working only as serfs to the Qara in return for security. Shahra men could not take wives from the master tribes although the women, lighter-skinned than most Dhofaris, were available to all as brides at especially low prices.<br><br>Out of a powerful sexual bond grew a friendship and trust that was rare in Dhofari marriages. Shamsa bore Amr four sons over the next seven years. Amr was a proud husband and father, a successful businessman and popular within the Bait Jarboat tribe when, in 1970, their sheikh died without a hereditary successor. The dead leader had spent much of his life avenging the tribe's honor following a series of raids which had decimated and impoverished them in the 1940s. There was great contention among the Bait Jarboat about who should succeed him. Those of the tribe associated with the hard-core communists of the PFLO had their champion, while the nonatheistic majority favored Amr, whose great wealth, personal wisdom and family connections were held in high esteem. Amr won and became sheikh.<br><br>Like most of his countrymen, from sheikh to humble wood collector, Amr and his sons fought with the PFLO for the freedom of Dhofar. One of his sons was killed in 1969, a second in 1972 and yet another in January 1975, all at the hands of the government forces. In accordance with the tribal tradition of thaa'r, or revenge, it was Amr's duty to avenge himself for the killing of his sons.<br><br>For three years, with the war at its height, the newly appointed Sheikh Amr did his best for the tribe, leaving his business concerns to his managers in the Gulf. In Dubai he was an extremely wealthy man, but on the jebel he lived much the same sort of life as other jebalis.<br><br>In 1974 Shamsa had conceived unexpectedly and, following a fall while she was driving their goats over the hill pastures, had died in childbirth. Amr was stunned. His tribal duties lost their importance to him. His popularity slowly waned and the machinations of his opponents stirred accordingly. A cousin named Hamoud, envious of Amr's position, used Amr's failure to fulfill the thaa'r and avenge the deaths of his three sons as fuel to rouse tribal sentiments against him.<br><br>Fundamentalist Islamic law embraces various rules, or sharia, but by far the most binding for a Dhofari are those of thaa'r. The aggrieved relative is expected by law to insist on an eye for an eye. In return for murder, execution. For manslaughter, blood money. No time limit is set on the deed of vengeance. It can take place forty years on, but the executor must show his intention clearly and act as circumstances allow.<br><br>There are many different applications of the thaa'r even within a single Islamic country, because the dictates of the Koran simply reflect, in a modified form, the principles of pre-Islamic tribal behavior. If among the elders of a tribe there is dissension as to how the hadiyth, the Prophet's sayings, should be applied, then a consensus of opinion, ijma', can produce any solution. Over the years the differences in the severity with which Koranic punishments are applied in different lands have increased greatly. Sunni, Shi'ite and, in Oman, Ibadi Muslims apply further differences as a result of their own considerable divergences within the body of Islam.<br><br>Sudan is a Muslim country but the thaa'r there has become all but nonexistent. In 1988 five Palestinian terrorists murdered two Sudanese and five British peace workers in a Khartoum hotel. They were arrested and the Sudanese government contacted the parents of the dead Britons through the Foreign Office. A middle-aged suburban couple in Britain were suddenly faced with the choice of whether they wished their child's murderers to be executed, fined or pardoned. They were unable to make up their minds, and all five terrorists were released from jail in January 1991. In Dhofar Sultan Qaboos has had enormous success in subduing the thaa'r, to the extent that there were more tit-for-tat killings in Northern Ireland in 1990 than there were thaa'r murders in Dhofar. But the hard-core believers merely bide their time.<br><br>In July 1990 a jebali civil servant, a long-since pardoned member of the PFLO, was commuting to his air-conditioned office in Salalah in his air-conditioned Mercedes. He stopped at a zebra crossing to allow a pedestrian to pass. Over the past twelve years the two men had often passed each other in the street. That morning something snapped in the mind of the civil servant and he rammed the pedestrian against a wall, seriously injuring him. He was sent to jail, having readily admitted his intention to kill the man, who had murdered his brother back in 1973.</p><h2>Pegasus in Space</h2><p><b>In a triumphant career spanning more than thirty years, Anne McCaffrey has won the devotion of millions of fans. Now she has written the exciting and long-awaited addition to her classic Pegasus series&#x2014;and the perfect link to her bestselling Rowan saga . . .</b><br><br>For an overpopulated Earth whose resources are strained to the breaking point, there is only one place to look for relief: straight up. With the successful completion of the Padrugoi Space Station, humanity has at last achieved its first large-scale permanent presence in space. But there are those who, for motives of their own, want Padrugoi to fail. Standing in their way are the Talented, men and women gifted with extraordinary mental powers that have made them as feared as they are respected--and utterly indispensable to the colonization effort. Now, as sabotage and attempted murder strike the Station, it's up to the Talented to save the day. Only who is going to save the Talented?<br><br>Pegasus in Space is the tale of Peter Reidinger, first Tower Prime!</p><p>Anne McCaffrey is best known for <i>The Dragonriders of Pern</i>, but her loose Talents series about superpsychics has been running almost as long. It began with the near-future <i>To Ride Pegasus</i>, continuing a couple of generations later in <i>Pegasus in Flight</i>. Book 2 introduced a crowd of new characters, notably the paralyzed boy Peter whose telekinetic talent can move not only his body without help from his ruined nervous system, but--with practice--even lift payloads into orbit.<p> <i>Pegasus in Space</i> follows directly, with mayhem and mutiny, at the opening of a manned space station, which Peter and talented friends helped build. Further hassles ensue during his training for space haulage work: obstructive bureaucrats, crooked suppliers, murder attempts, and skillful sabotage. McCaffrey specializes in feel-good adventure SF, full of romance, warm friendships, and hearty meals. Somehow her villains never quite convince, though, and their evil deeds are so rapidly annulled that the story rarely builds up much suspense. Meanwhile, the orphan girl Amiriyah who's adopted into Peter's family has a mysterious, subtle talent of her own, one that we soon guess will change his life. Our young hero's ambitions foreshadow later far-future books in the series (beginning with <i>The Rowan</i>) in which "kinetics" hurl cargo across huge interstellar gulfs. While most people think his talent needs careful conservation, Peter has already teleported supplies to the moon and has secret plans for Mars, the asteroids, and the moons of Jupiter. It all makes for an agreeable, lightweight read. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br>"McCaffrey's world of the Talented is as vivid as that of Pern and its dragons."<br>--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"[McCaffrey is] a master of the well-told tale."<br>--Chicago Sun-Times</p><h2>Dancing with God: The Trinity from a Womanist Perspective</h2><p><i>Dancing With God</i> is an exploration of the divine gifts of courage and grace in the face of evil. Moreover, it is a doctrine of God as the source of that courage. Baker-Fletcher presents an understanding of the work of the Trinity with regard to the problem of crucifixion, a metaphor she uses for unnecessary violence. She develops a process of relational, womanist theology that considers the empathetic omnipresence of God in the midst of unnecessary suffering and the healing power of God in movement of the Holy Spirit. She engages the contributions of a diversity of theologians like Paul Tillich, Karl Barth, Gordon Kaufman, John Cobb, Jr., Majorie Suchocki, Charles Hartshorne, Andrew Sung Park, and Katie Cannon in her discussion of the dance of the Trinity in creation, and the problem of sin, evil, and suffering. Through creative works like that of Alice Walker's <i>The Color Purple </i>and journalist Joyce King's account of the James Byrd, Jr. murder in Jasper County, Texas, Baker-Fletcher reveals the healing, encouraging power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of survivors of unnecessary violence.</p><p>Karen Baker-Fletcher is professor of systematic theology at Perkins School of Theology in Dallas, Texas. She is the author of <i>Dancing With God: A Womanist Perspective </i>on the Trinity and numerous writings on womanist thought, christology, and the relationship between God and creation.</p><h2>Trespassing Across America: One Man&#39;s Epic, Never-Done-Before (and Sort of Illegal) Hike Across the Heartland</h2><p><b>Winner of the Nebraska Center for the Book Award, Travel&nbsp;<b><b>&nbsp;<b>� A&nbsp;</b></b></b>Sigurd Olson Nature Writing Award Notable Book <b><b>&nbsp;<b>� Honoree of the&nbsp;</b></b></b>Society of Midland Authors Annual Literary Award for Biography/Memoir<br><br>Now that President Donald Trump has revived the Keystone XL pipeline that was rejected by former President Obama, <i>Trespassing Across America</i>&nbsp;is the book to help us understand the kaleidoscopic significance of the project.&nbsp;Told with sincerity, humor, and wit, Ilgunas's story&nbsp;is both a fascinating account of one man&#x2019;s remarkable journey along the pipeline's potential path and a meditation on climate change, the beauty of the natural world, and the extremes to which we can push ourselves&#x2014;both physically and mentally.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> It started as a far-fetched idea&#x2014;to hike the entire length of the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline. But in the months that followed, it grew into something more for Ken Ilgunas. It became an irresistible adventure&#x2014;an opportunity not only to draw attention to global warming but also to explore his personal limits. So in September 2012, he strapped on his backpack, stuck out his thumb on the interstate just north of Denver, and hitchhiked 1,500 miles to the Alberta tar sands. Once there, he turned around and began his 1,700-mile trek to the XL&#x2019;s endpoint on the Gulf Coast of Texas, a journey he would complete entirely on foot, walking almost exclusively across private property.<br><br>Both a travel memoir and a reflection on climate change,&nbsp;<i>Trespassing Across America</i>&nbsp;is filled with colorful characters, harrowing physical trials, and strange encounters with the weather, terrain, and animals of America&#x2019;s plains. A tribute to the Great Plains and the people who live there, Ilgunas&#x2019;s memoir grapples with difficult questions about our place in the world: What is our personal responsibility as stewards of the land? As members of a rapidly warming planet? As mere individuals up against something as powerful as the fossil fuel industry? Ultimately, <i>Trespassing Across America</i>&nbsp;is a call to embrace the belief that a life lived not half wild is a life only half lived. It's the perfect travelers gift for fans of <i>Free Solo </i>and <i>Turn Right at Machu Picchu</i>.</p><p><b>Ken Ilgunas</b> has worked as an elementary school tutor, an Alaskan tour guide, and a backcountry ranger at the Gates of the Arctic National Park.

It was late and dark, yet the storm clouds zipping from one end of the sky to the other still held within them a curious pink-red hue. Between the time lapse&#x2013;like passage of the clouds and the deathly still tundra plain (where the wind has no trees to shake or leaves to scatter), I felt as if I were entering some disturbing, unworldly, goat-headed netherworld.</p><p>&#x201c;This place is just weird,&#x201d; said Liam, a cook in the passenger&#x2019;s seat, looking up at the clouds.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking the same thing,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Deadhorse houses about three thousand oil-field laborers who live at the work camp for a month at a time before they fly back to wherever&#x2019;s home for a week or two. In Deadhorse, there are no churches, schools, families or anything that would make it resemble a normal American town. It is a cold, lifeless, cheerless (and nearly femaleless) place where nobody in his right mind would ever want to live&#x2014;an assertion that would insult no one, as it is held most ardently by those who call themselves permanent residents.</p><p>I pulled into the Deadhorse Camp parking lot and carefully stepped out into fifty-mile-per-hour winds, placing my feet into the mud-gravel ground with all of my weight for fear that my handful of linens and I would capsize with the next heavy gust.</p><p>How I found myself in Deadhorse is worth a story of its own, but suffice it to say, I was desperate and needed money. I&#x2019;d moved up to Alaska with the intention of turning a series of blog essays (from my web site, regrettably named The Spartan Student) into a book about a few years of my life during which I lived in a van so that I could afford grad school. But after a series of disappointments, I had to set my sights on the much more practical task of eking out a living.</p><p>Deadhorse Camp is a steely rectangular Halliburton housing unit that runs entirely on diesel fuel. I worked alongside four coworkers all my age, cooking and cleaning for about fifty oil-field workers who stayed at our camp. Oddly enough, three of us had college degrees in English&#x2014;a degree that clearly did nothing to prepare us for the duties of succeeding in the professional world but did, however, empower us to have impassioned forty-five-minute conversations about whether the film Scream does or does not fit within the horror genre.</p><p>I was given one side of a red-and-white outdoor Travco trailer that was outfitted with giant skis so it could be dragged over the ice in winter. The manager encouragingly referred to it as my &#x201c;writing studio,&#x201d; but the desk, which had been glued to the wall decades before, fell off the moment I placed my laptop on it.</p><p>Coworkers shared the communal shower with the tourists and pipeline workers. Because, as we were told, water cost thirty-five cents a gallon, it was no surprise that the water flowed from the shower nozzle at an exasperating dribble. The water pressure being so slight, I had to stand directly beneath it. Whenever I turned to wash a different part of my body, I&#x2019;d accidentally nudge the hot-cold dial, which was hyper sensitive, so much so that a millimeter adjustment to the left or right would send either a boiling, skin-melting trickle onto my shoulders or a polar, heart-stopping slush.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t mind my accommodations at all. In fact, I was plenty amused with the novelty of the camp and its eccentric drabness, but the work&#x2014;the work!&#x2014;was depressing. I&#x2019;d come into the kitchen at six p.m. (the &#x201c;dish shift&#x201d;) and scrub the bottoms of burned soup pots, dip my hand into sink drains to pluck out handfuls of slippery vegetables, and cram heavy black industrial trash bags into polar bear&#x2013;proof dumpsters. I&#x2019;d set up the salad bar, slice the bread, arrange the dessert rack, fold used cardboard, and clean up the kitchen for the morning cook. There once was a time when I was a student, a park ranger, an adventurer. And now look at me. Dishwasher.</p><p>&#x201c;It sounds like your inner Odysseus is lost at sea,&#x201d; said Liam, Deadhorse&#x2019;s thirty-year-old prize chef. I&#x2019;d just let out a sigh for the third time in an hour while trying to use a wire brush to scrub dried specks of mashed potato off the rim of a large metal stirring bowl.</p><p>Oh, Liam. How I liked Liam! Every evening we&#x2019;d work alongside each other. He&#x2019;d cook, I&#x2019;d clean, and we&#x2019;d talk. Our conversations were the only thing I looked forward to. Liam was a few years older than I was. He was extremely well-read and the sort of person who knows all the names of Homer&#x2019;s Greek characters and who could apply his erudition to everyday issues, like the way he assigned some of the few female Deadhorse oil-field laborers with personality-revealing names such as &#x201c;Circe&#x201d; and &#x201c;Calypso.&#x201d; Liam was one of those rare people you come across in life who you want to stuff into a sack and carry with you wherever you go.</p><p>My Deadhorse stay was supposed to last only a couple of weeks, but it would turn into a couple of months. Over the course of the summer, I&#x2019;d gone from the glorified title of writer-in-residence, to tour guide, to dishwasher, as if I were on some cruel, Scrooge-like, time-traveling tour, visiting my jobs of yesteryear, each demanding less skill and responsibility than the last.</p><p>I cursed more. I told crass, tasteless jokes. I wore smelly, stained, soup-splattered shirts. I spent my nights drinking Pabst and watching TV series after TV series, and the beginnings of a paunch steadily strained the elastic in my black kitchen pants. I knew things were going from pathetic to thinking, Maybe Cymbalta is right for me? when I dropped a tray of turkey lunch meat onto the floor, and instead of cursing, I just stared at the meat sprawled across the linoleum in deadly silence.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to get out,&#x201d; Liam said. &#x201c;We need to see the ocean.&#x201d;</p><p>Our plan was to walk five miles to the Sagavanirktok (or Sag) River and paddle north three miles to the Arctic Ocean in lightweight inflatable kayaks called packrafts. We&#x2019;d then paddle west for a few miles along the coast before heading back to Deadhorse, where we needed to be back in time for our kitchen shifts the next morning.</p><p>We put on dry suits, strapped light backpacks around our shoulders, and hiked out over the flat, firm, easy-on-the-feet tundra. The fall foliage was colored with squash yellows, apple reds, and pumpkin oranges. Most of the birds had migrated south, but there were vestiges of summer swarms of flying life: snowy owls, loons, floating gulls, flocks of geese, and a clatter of ravens. Off to the north&#x2014;through Liam&#x2019;s binoculars&#x2014;we saw a golden eagle on the ground flapping its wings at a ghost-white arctic fox that was obnoxiously running laps around it.</p><p>We inflated the packrafts and let the Sag&#x2014;swift and powerful at these northern latitudes&#x2014;carry us to the Arctic Ocean. The ocean, though, wasn&#x2019;t a mere couple of miles away as Liam thought it was. Behind every bend in the river, we expected to see the chilly gray expanse of the ocean, but the river continued to meander northward with no end in sight.</p><p>Our leisurely paddle downriver was brought to a halt when we caught sight of something big and white and round. Liam and I pulled over to the bank instinctively.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you see that?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>He took out his binoculars.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what it is, but it&#x2019;s big and it&#x2019;s moving,&#x201d; Liam said nervously.</p><p>We were unarmed except for a canister of bear spray, and we had no strategy for dealing with a polar bear except to (1) Wait for it to get within twenty feet so we could drizzle it with a puff of cayenne or (2) Drop everything and hopelessly scamper across the empty tundra, which, with each passing second, appeared to be the far more sensible option.</p><p>I frantically deflated my raft and sloppily strapped it to the outside of my pack with frozen hands covered in wet sand. The polar bear continued its swim toward us, my heart leaping every time I looked up and saw that it was getting closer. It was only a matter of seconds before we would have to drop everything and enthusiastically commit to our coldly Darwinian &#x201c;whoever&#x2019;s fastest wins&#x201d; option number two, but the bear turned out to be nothing more than a drifting seagull leisurely floating down the Sag. (One&#x2019;s depth perception, we learned, cannot be trusted on this flat, lunar, North Slope landscape.)<br>Okay, no polar bear, thank God, but we had other problems to deal with. For one, because of the rushed, slapdash nature of our adventure, we didn&#x2019;t think to bring any sleeping bags or tents. And because we were so far north and well past the northern tree line, there was no wood to start a fire. And after looking at my GPS, I saw that we had a twelve-mile hike back to Deadhorse, which would actually be more like fifteen when you factor in all the ponds, lakes, and tundra bogs we&#x2019;d have to walk around. And our biggest problem: we would have to walk through the vigilantly monitored, hyper-secure Prudhoe Bay oil field&#x2014;the largest oil field in North America that, before drilling started in 1977, held twenty-five billion barrels of oil. Hiking through the oil field is strictly prohibited, and while we had no desire to break the law, there was no way we could get around Prudhoe Bay. We&#x2019;d have to sneak through. We&#x2019;d have to trespass.</p><p>We had walked a mile southwest, or what we thought was southwest, and when I looked down and picked up my pack that I&#x2019;d set down a moment before, I wasn&#x2019;t sure which direction we&#x2019;d come from and which direction we were supposed to head. I did a 360. And then another 360. I was spinning.</p><p>The land around us was perfectly flat. The sky was an overcast gray. Everything, up and down, left and right, looked exactly the same. I frantically spun and spun and spun, seeking a hill, a distant building, or a blotch of sunshine behind the clouds that might bring some sense to this senselessly unvarying plains landscape. But there was nothing. I pulled out my GPS, and it gave a different directional reading each time I looked at it. Twisting in circles, my compass seemed to be just as disoriented as I was. The plains, which I&#x2019;d thought to be the epitome of monotony and tranquility, turned out to be as mysterious and menacing as the core of a smoldering volcano.</p><p>Sit down, Ken, I told myself. Calm down.</p><p>But in addition to panic, I felt something else: the jolt of a raw encounter with an unforgiving wilderness, the exuberance of having a firsthand experience with the world, a wild gush of emotions that made me feel, though scared and panicky, overflowing with life.</p><p>I sat down and made myself eat a sandwich. My compass needle ceased its spinning, and I was finally able to locate the bland southwesterly direction we needed to head toward.</p><p>Hours passed. Night replaced day and a frosty mist clung to my facial hair. On the edge of a lake in front of us stood a giant bull caribou bearing a curled crown of antlers that were orbited by two batlike short-eared owls, both of which&#x2014;after the caribou had regally trotted off and disappeared into the fog&#x2014;came to inspect us, hovering silently above our heads like kites.</p><p>The distant horizon was speckled with the lights of oil camps and roadway lamps. In front of us was one such oil camp, a small metallic facility with about a dozen outdoor lights. We were all whispers now, wary of being caught and having to deal with the possibility of an interrogation, a fine for trespassing, or something worse. It was close to midnight, so we thought we could slip by undetected. As we neared the building, we saw some humanlike movement. A spotlight clicked on. Whoever was manning the light drew figure eights onto the tundra until he trained the spotlight directly on us.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re screwed,&#x201d; I whispered. </p><p>&#x201c;Just stay still,&#x201d; Liam said. &#x201c;If they come near, just lie on the ground.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? I don&#x2019;t know, man. Maybe it would be better if we just gave in if they&#x2019;ve already caught us.&#x201d;</p><p>I was equal parts disturbed by and admiring of Liam&#x2019;s composure. How was he not nervous? We stood still for minutes&#x2014;two mannequins frozen in midstride whispering out of the corners of our mouths&#x2014;until we decided that the guy with the spotlight was probably too far away to see us. We started hiking again, lengthening our strides and adding an alarmed briskness to our gaits. We reached an industrial road and placed our footsteps in sync with each other&#x2019;s to reduce the volume of our boots&#x2019; crunch over the gravel. We ducked under a pipeline and continued on.</p><p>There were lights everywhere in all directions. White lights, orange lights, red lights, blinking lights, the lights of trucks prowling from facility to facility. They knew we were out there. Because of the depth perception problem, we couldn&#x2019;t tell which lights were close and which were far away. The buzz of machines was everywhere: beeps, honks, and whirring engines that had us swiveling our heads every few moments.</p><p>Looking over the facilities, I thought that there was something disturbing about this place, this barren coastal plain. I&#x2019;d felt it ever since I&#x2019;d come up here and more so now that I was walking through the oil fields. The place made me think of the film Black Narcissus, set in the Himalayas in an old palace that a few well-meaning nuns were trying in vain to transform into a school. The wind from the mountains drove the nuns mad. It never stopped. It moved into their rooms, invading, molesting, reminding them, like a ghost, that this place is and always will be a place of kings and queens, jewels and perfumes, self-indulgence and debauchery, and that you can either accept that or die trying to change it.</p><p>That&#x2019;s how I felt about Deadhorse. That we shouldn&#x2019;t be there. That this place was meant to be still and silent, unbothered and undeveloped. The giant drills, the mud-spattered trucks, the rusty oil barrels, the big diesel-run complex. It bore a special brand of ugliness&#x2014;the ugliness of a place existing in complete disharmony with its surroundings. The oil was finite and Deadhorse was temporary. We&#x2019;ll make a mess of the area for a few decades then leave the corrugated mess to the cold and wind forever after. And we are not real inhabitants&#x2014;just suckerfish along for the ride, desperately clinging to the belly of the great oil-filled beast.</p><p>The Inuit, who once lived along these shores, built homes from the earth, kayaks from skins, clothes from fur. They lived and died here for thousands of years, leaving not the slightest blemish on the land. Surely they didn&#x2019;t view the coastal plain the way the oilman does. Here, the Inuit&#x2019;s eye was probably drawn to caribou browsing ami...</p></p><h2>The Essential Book of Homesteading: The Ultimate Guide to Sustainable Living (Homemade Living)</h2><p><b>All the information you need to homestead&#x2014;gathered in one ultimate, essential book!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In barnyards and backyards, on rooftops and in alleyways, a movement is happening&#x2014;the modern homesteading movement.

Amundson could hear Sergeant Nunez beside him, reciting rapid-fire Hail Marys, working through a set of rosary beads in what looked to the young cavalry officer like record time. Across the cabin Private Clarke was nervously tapping his heel on the steel plating of the floor, the tempo increasing until it sounded like one of those rock-and-roll drummers. Then he'd curse, punch himself on the leg, and go still for a moment before starting all over again.<br><br>On either side of him a couple of the boys were dozing fitfully. Or at least pretending to.<br><br>That's how it went the whole way across. Each man playing out what might be his last hour as he saw fit. Some checked their equipment, before checking their buddy's. Some leaned over to get a view of the invasion fleet as it headed for the coast. Corporal Gadsden craned his head skyward, the bulky lens of his Gen2 Starlite goggles tracking his gaze as he picked out Dakotas, gliders, Mustang night fighters, and, at one point, a squadron of Sabers miles overhead, all screaming toward France.<br><br>Amundson forced himself to go through the plan again. The rapid insertion, the assembly point for his platoon, the mental map of their objective.<br><br>He used what little space he had in the chopper to perform a set of isometric exercises, lest his butt fall asleep before they jumped into Hitler's front garden. He stretched his arms and legs and craned his neck from side to side, a full extension in each direction, which gave him a clear view of the rest of the cav squadron as it thundered toward the enemy in 132 Hueys, with another forty Cobra gunships riding shotgun.<br><br>It seemed that the demonic roar of so many engines, the great thudding of all those rotors, could surely be heard in Berlin itself. But as quickly as the thought came to him, it was gone.<br><br>A quick glance forward through the armored glass canopy revealed the firestorm that was engulfing the Pas de Calais. So much high explosive had been dropped on that small region of France, it would be a wonder if anything bigger than a flea still lived down there. There'd even been talk back in England that Ike might bust a nuke over the krauts, although Amundson doubted that. They hadn't been outfitted to fight in radioactive terrain.<br><br>That wouldn't stop the Nazis, though, he supposed. Axis Sally had been taunting the Allies for weeks now, claiming that the Reich was just waiting for them to set foot on the Continent, giving them an excuse to use the first of their many, many A-bombs. Amundson glanced down, then back at the lead elements of the great fleet headed for the beaches of Calais. At least his squadron was probably too small a target to justify the use of such a weapon.<br><br>No, they were probably just gonna get chewed to bits by German jet fighters.<br><br>Ah, screw it.<br><br>He figured the same doubts were gnawing through every man in the operation. Eisenhower himself was probably being tortured by the same sort of fears. Ever since the Transition, so much was known, but so much more was unknowable.<br><br>There was one person who didn't seem to give a shit, though, and she was sitting directly across from him. She was a civilian, but she'd seen more combat than any of them. Maybe even anyone in the whole squadron. Amundson knew a few guys who'd fought in the Pacific, but almost everyone else in the Seventh had never fired a shot-not in combat. Nor had they come under fire themselves.<br><br>But they'd trained as hard as any outfit in the world. And in one of those weird, head-spinning paradoxes, they'd learned the lessons of another<br><br>D-Day, one that had taken place on another world. Amundson knew, for instance, that a field full of French cows most likely wasn't mined, but if those cows kept staring at a bush or a hedgerow, there was probably a German hiding there. Their equipment was without a doubt the best. The poor old infantry, down in those Higgins boats, they didn't get any Starlite goggles, or even body armor. And they were still armed with the M1 Garand, not the brand-new assault rifles with integrated grenade launchers.<br><br>But even though he'd been honed to a razor's edge and was riding at the head of the most powerful cavalry unit ever assembled, Gil Amundson couldn't help but wonder. Would he crumble when the first bullet zipped past? Would he freeze up over the Landing Zone? Would he fail his men? And would he look like a coward in front of this woman who seemed not to give a damn that they were less than an hour away from certain death?<br><br>The chopper banked sharply as the dark sky to the north suddenly filled with dozens of beautiful, sinuous lines of light. Tracer fire. Where the hell had that come from? They'd been told that the air force was going to bomb the coast back to the Stone Age.<br><br>He struggled to get a view back to the rest of the squadron, which followed the lead chopper. He heard the copilot calling in a position estimate for the antiaircraft batteries and half expected to see a couple of gunships peeling away to deal with them. But everyone stayed in formation, pressing on toward the objective.<br><br>They left the lead elements of the fleet behind them. The only movement on the sea was a rippling crescent of reflected moonlight as they sped on. The pilot's voice crackled out of a speaker above Amundson's head. "We'll be over the coastline in five minutes."<br><br>Amundson looked south as four gunships pulled ahead, their job to rake the ground clear of defenders. When he looked back at the woman, she was talking to Gadsden. Or rather he was yelling something in her ear. She smiled and nodded.<br><br>Amundson felt a brief, irrational surge of jealousy. He slowly and deliberately stamped it down. She wasn't his girl, after all. They'd shared a bed in London for a couple of nights, made love in ways he hadn't thought possible-and which wouldn't have been, if he wasn't in such amazing physical shape. But she'd made it clear that she wanted nothing more than sex. She didn't even like to cuddle. The couple of times he'd tried, she had rolled on top of him, fucked him insensible, then rolled off and gone back to sleep.<br><br>When he'd told his best buddies, lieutenants Savo and Lobes, they'd stared at him like he'd just won the Kentucky Derby. And actually, it kinda bugged him, them just looking at him like he was out of his mind.<br><br>Julia Duffy was famous. And beautiful. And rumor had it that she was as rich as a Rockefeller. So if he didn't feel like sharing her bed, then Savo and Lobes reckoned they'd be more than happy to volunteer. After all, if she was good enough for the president of the United States of America-well, he'd be president someday, at least, if he survived the war-then who were they to turn her away?<br><br>Amundson caught himself staring at her just before she locked eyes with him. He glanced away guiltily.<br><br>Julia kicked him. It would have hurt if he hadn't been wearing a thick rubber knee pad.<br><br>"You and your boys, you'll be fine, Lieutenant," she called out over the noise. "Don't sweat it. You're gonna eat those fuckers alive. Garry-fuckin'-owen."<br><br>The men in his chalk roared back.<br><br>"Garryowen!"<br><br>Amundson smiled. But he felt sick in the pit of his stomach.<br><br>About three months after the Allies had retaken Hawaii, a package had arrived for Julia at The New York Times. She'd been back home for a month by then. After the slaughter on Oahu, the paper had insisted that she take a proper vacation, and to everyone's surprise she had agreed.<br><br>She'd still been with Dan at that point, but she hadn't gone out to the Zone. Hadn't even bothered to phone and tell him she was back. Mostly, she just stayed drunk.<br><br>She did manage to visit Rosanna's family, and for about three hours in their company she felt half human. But she fell apart when Poppi Ugo brought out the family album and insisted on taking her through every shot they had of Rosanna. She'd guzzled down nearly three- quarters of a bottle of grappa, crying hysterically all the time, and had passed out on the couch. She woke up at three in the morning, shivering under the Natoli family quilt, then vomited and snuck out the front door, leaving twenty dollars to cover the dry-cleaning bill. Hours later she remembered that dry cleaning as she knew it didn't exist yet.<br><br>She'd gone back to apologize, but the Natoli clan refused to hear it. They tried to talk her into staying for another 188-course dinner, but-fearing a meltdown-she had begged off and fled back to the city. The next she heard from them was when this package turned up at the Times.<br><br>The mailroom cleared about a thousand items a week for Julia. Letters from servicemen she'd written about. Cookies baked by their moms. Crayola drawings by little girls who said they wanted to grow up and be just like her. And at the other extreme, hate mail and death threats from fans of the former FBI director who blamed her for his ruin, or from nutjobs who just didn't like her. There were plenty of those. Many of them working for the same paper as her.<br><br>The package from Rosanna's family lay on her desk for about two weeks before she could bring herself to do anything about it. Worried that she might fall apart in front of her colleagues, Julia had carried the parcel back to her apartment and left it in a closet for nearly a month.<br><br>It took a fifteen-hour liquid lunch at the Bayswater before she could get it back out of the closet, and two pots of black coffee before she could take a knife to the packing tape without cutting a finger off.<br><br>She had no idea what was waiting in there. Part of her thought the Natolis might have sent the quilt over for her to clean up. But the package wasn't big enough, and when she spilled the contents of the thick, padded envelope onto her Castiglioni coffee table, a small "Oh!" escaped her, and she had to run to the bathroom to be sick again.<br><br>The snoring man in her bed stirred but didn't wake as she lost a whole day's worth of Manhattans and finger food in the bathroom. She sucked a few mouthfuls of cold water straight from the faucet, thought about taking a shower, and decided to go without, lest she wake up the asshole in her bedroom.<br><br>Walking very unsteadily back into the lounge area of her huge open living space, Julia studied the sad collection of personal effects that lay on the tabletop. Rosanna's flexipad and a dozen data sticks, a traditional leather-bound diary, some jewelry, an Herm�s scarf, her imitation Bordigoni handbag, a wristwatch, a small piece of notepaper, and some cosmetics.<br><br>Julia stared at the pile of detritus for a long time while her stomach threatened to rebel again. She tried to think, but it was as though her mind could gain no traction. It kept slipping over the sight in front of her, refusing to latch on to anything in particular. After a few minutes, with a shaking hand, she picked up the piece of paper.<br><br>Rosanna's great auntie Tula had written on it in her large, looping style.<br><br>Dearest Julia.<br><br>A very kind Captain Schapelli from the army came by today with a large carton of little Rosie's belongings recovered from Hawaii. She had made out a will and hidden it in her apartment. The Japanese killed everyone there, I hear, but they never found Rosie's last testament or the things she had hidden away. Captain Schapelli, a lovely boy, but Jewish, insisted that we send them to you. He's quite a fan. There is a larger box, which we could not afford to send because of the postage being what it is these days, and Captain Schapelli says there are some things in there for you, too. We would love to have you around for dinner again, and you could collect the things little Rosie wanted you to have. Please do call or write.<br><br>Love and best wishes, Tula<br><br>Eight months later Julia sat braced against the forward bulkhead of the lead chopper. It was the Seventh Cav's first charge since they'd gone tearing around after Pancho Villa.<br><br>She adjusted a shoulder pad as Corporal Gadsden yelled something into her ear about a couple of London barmaids he'd screwed a couple of weeks earlier. What a dick, she thought, but she just smiled and nodded.<br><br>Her titanium weave armor was way past its expiration date. It'd been repaired time and again with reactive matrix panels and patches bought, borrowed, and occasionally stolen from other twenty-first- century reporters who didn't share her enthusiasm for front-line action. So it had taken on the appearance of a camouflage quilt. The ballistic plating was brand new, though, thanks to Rosanna, who had left all her own mostly unused equipment to her friend.<br><br>A brief, sad smile died at the edge of Julia's mouth.<br><br>Still lookin' out for me, babe.<br><br>The copilot's voice crackled inside her powered helmet. "Ten minutes to insertion."<br><br>Amundson repeated the call and held up both hands. Everyone nodded.<br><br>Julia could see that the young officer was trying to control his nerves. She guessed it had less to do with fear of being killed than with fear of fucking up and letting everyone down. He was a sweet kid, really. They'd had some good times in London, even if he was a little clingy. In fact, thinking about it, she'd spent more time with Gil than any man she'd been with after Dan had died.<br><br>And now the poor kid was shitting himself.<br><br>"You and your boys, you'll be fine, Lieutenant," she yelled over the uproar. "Don't sweat it. You're gonna eat those fuckers alive. Garry fuckin' Owen."<br><br>She punched the air between them.<br><br>The men grinned fiercely and called out the Seventh Cav's war cry.<br><br>As the troopers began yet another round of equipment checks, Julia performed her own precombat routine. A software aid scanned all her built-in combat systems, most of which were useless now anyway for want of tac-net coverage. She unsheathed her knife. The monobonded carbon blade was a dull gray, but more than razor sharp. Her Sonycam was powered up and loaded with four blank data sticks-again thanks to Rosanna-enough for two days' continuous filming. Her medikit was an eccentric mix of original 21C supplies, some AT stuff, and some plain old-fashioned 'temp gear-assorted twentieth-century items she'd scavenged here and there.</p><h2>The Joy of Chemistry: The Amazing Science of Familiar Things</h2><p>This book challenges the perception of chemistry as too difficult to bother with and too clinical to be any fun. Cathy Cobb and Monty L. Fetterolf, both professional chemists and experienced educators, introduce readers to the magic, elegance, and, yes, joy of chemistry. From the fascination of fall foliage and fireworks, to the functioning of smoke detectors and computers, to the fundamentals of digestion (as when good pizza goes bad!), the authors illustrate the concepts of chemistry in terms of everyday experience, using familiar materials.The authors begin with a bang-a colorful bottle rocket assembled from common objects you find in the garage-and then present the principles of chemistry using household chemicals and friendly, nontechnical language. They guide the reader through the basics of atomic structure, the nature of molecular bonds, and the vibrant universe of chemical reactions. Using analogy and example to illuminate essential concepts such as thermodynamics, photochemistry, electrochemistry, and chemical equilibrium, they explain the whys and wherefores of chemical reactions. Hands-on demonstrations, selected for their ease of execution and relevance, illustrate basic principles, and lively commentaries emphasize the fun and fascination of learning about chemistry.This delightful and richly informative book amply proves that chemistry can appeal to our intuition, logic, and-if we&#39;re willing to get down and dirty-our sense of enjoyment too.</p><p><b>Cathy Cobb </b>(Aiken, SC) is the author of <i>Crime Scene Chemistry for the Armchair Sleuth</i> (with Monty L. Fetterolf and Jack G. Goldsmith); <i>Magick, Mayhem, and Mavericks: The Spirited History of Physical Chemistry</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Creations of Fire: Chemistry&#x2019;s Lively History from Alchemy to the Atomic Age</i>&nbsp;(with H. Goldwhite). She is currently an instructor of calculus and physics at Aiken Preparatory School and an adjunct professor of chemistry at the University of South Carolina at Aiken. <br><br><b>Monty L. Fetterolf</b> (Aiken, SC) is the coauthor with Cathy Cobb and Jack G. Goldsmith of <i>Crime Scene Chemistry for the Armchair Sleuth</i>. He is a professor of chemistry at the University of South Carolina at Aiken.Think of this as a chemistry education condensed into a single book: a lightning tour of the field for the uninitiated. What the work lacks in depth is made up for in breadth, covering all the material of a general chemistry course along with organic, inorganic and analytical chemistry and biochemistry; there's even a chapter on forensic chemistry. Cobb and Fetterolf, professors of chemistry at the University of South Carolina, avoid math and focus on real-world examples. They explain everything from flatulence (the chemical composition of intestinal gas) to pizza cheese (why mozzarella rather than, say, parmesan?). This may sound a lot like the dozens of introductory chemistry books on the market. But unlike most others, this book comes with a lab component (supplies not included). Every chapter is preceded by an experiment (some quite complicated) using household goods, though someone inexperienced in laboratory techniques may find the directions difficult to follow. The explanations of principles fly past, and Cobb and Fetterolf avoid oversimplifying the chemistry, which may leave some readers confused. Whether or not readers fully understand the principles of chemistry by the end of the book, they will at least have a better understanding of the world around them and enough everyday trivia to hold their own at a cocktail party.

Today it is recited daily by Dominican, Carmelite, Augustinian, and by large numbers of the Franciscan, Tertiaries, as well as by many pious laymen who desire to take part in the liturgical prayer of the Church. It is worth noting that the form of the Little Office of Our Lady has varied considerably at different periods and in different places. The earlier versions varied very considerably, chiefly as regards the hymns and antiphons used: in England in medieval times the main differences seem to have been between the Sarum and York Uses. Since the time of St. Pius V, that most commonly recited has been the version of the reformed Breviary of that pope. In this version, which suffers somewhat from the classicism of the sixteenth century, are to be found the seven "Hours," as in the Greater Office. At Matins, after the versicles follow the invitatory "Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum" with the "Venite" then the hymn "Quem terra, pontus, sidera"; then three groups of psalms, each with their antiphons, of which one group is said on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays, the second on Tuesdays and Fridays, the third on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Next follow three lessons with responsories and (except in Lent and Advent) the "Te Deum." At Lauds, there are the eight psalms of the Divine Office for Sundays, sung to five antiphons. Then the Little Chapter, and the hymn "O Gloriosa Virginum." Next a versicle and the canticle "Benedictus" with its antiphon. Lastly, the prayer and commemoration of the saints. In each of the four Little Hours the hymn "Memento rerum conditor" immediately follows the versicles; then three psalms are recited, under one of the antiphons of Lauds; then are said the Little Chapter, versicles, and a prayer. At Vespers, after the versicles and five psalms with their antiphons, follow the Little Chapter, the hymn "Ave Maris stella," a short versicle, and the canticle "Magnificat" with its antiphon; then the prayers as at Lauds. Compline begins with special versicles, then follow three psalms without antiphons, then the hymn "Memento rerum conditor," a Little Chapter, a versicle, the canticle "Nunc Dimittis," versicles, a prayer, and the Benediction. After the hours are recited the "Pater Noster" and the proper antiphon of Our Lady for the season. This last, the antiphons of the psalms and canticles and the Little Chapters are the only parts of the office that vary with the seasons. Pope Leo XIII granted (17 Nov., 1887), to those who recite the whole Office of Our Lady, an indulgence daily of seven years and seven quarantines, and a plenary indulgence once a month; to those who recite Matins and Lauds only, a daily indulgence of three hundred days; and (8 Dec., 1897) to those who recite Vespers and Compline only, and for each Hour, an indulgence of fifty days.</p></p><p></p><h2>Berlin</h2><p><p><b>Best of 2018 nods from the <i>Washington Post</i>, New York Public Library, <i>Globe and Mail,</i> <i>the Guardian</i>, and more!</b></p><p><b>"The magic in <i>Berlin</i> is in the way Lutes conjures, out of old newspapers and photographs, a city so remote from him in time and space...

Few of us can name the White activists who joined the struggle against discrimination, let alone understand the complexities, stresses and contradictions of doing this work while benefiting from the privileges they enjoyed as Whites. <br><br>This book fills that gap by vividly presenting &#x2013; in their own words &#x2013; the personal stories, experiences and reflections of fifteen prominent White anti-racists. They recount the circumstances that led them to undertake this work, describe key moments and insights along their journeys, and frankly admit their continuing lapses and mistakes. They make it clear that confronting oppression (including their own prejudices) &#x2013; whether about race, sexual orientation, ability or other differences &#x2013; is a lifelong process of learning. <br><br>The chapters in this book are full of inspirational and lesson-rich stories about the expanding awareness of White social justice advocates and activists who grappled with their White privilege and their early socialization and decided to work against structural injustice and personal prejudice. The authors are also self-critical, questioning their motivations and commitments, and acknowledging that &#x2013; as Whites and possessors of other privileged identities &#x2013; they continue to benefit from White privilege even as they work against it.<br><br>This is an eye-opening book for anyone who wants to understand what it means to be White and the reality of what is involved in becoming a White anti-racist and social justice advocate; is interested in the paths taken by those who have gone before; and wants to engage reflectively and critically in this difficult and important work.<br><br><b>Contributing Authors</b><br>Warren J.

Law professor Michael Schutt believes that although there are significant obstacles, Christians belong in the legal profession and should regard it as a sacred calling. The Christian God is, after all, a God concerned with justice, both divine and human. However, the pathway beginning with law school and leading to the daily demands of practice doesn&#39;t provide much guidance for pursuing law as a Christian calling. Schutt offers this book as a vital resource for reconceiving the theoretical foundations of law and gives practical guidance for maintaining integrity within a challenging profession. A hopeful and practical book for law students and those serving in the legal profession.</p><p>&#34;Many Christian law students and lawyers have never begun to explore what their faith means for their professional lives. One reason has been the lack of quality resources to help illuminate the path. With this book, Michael Schutt has helped fill the void by providing a resource that is theologically deep and practically relevant. Whether you&#39;re a beginning law student or a senior partner at a firm, this book is a must-read if you&#39;re serious about reflecting on what it means to be a Christian lawyer.&#34; (Robert K.

In his searing new novel, a young Arab journalist returns to his hometown &#x2014; an Arab village within Israel &#x2014; where his already vexed sense of belonging is forced to crisis when the village becomes a pawn in the never-ending power struggle that is the Middle East. Hoping to reclaim the simplicity of life among kin, the prodigal son returns home to find that nothing is as he remembers: everything is smaller, the people are petty and provincial. But when Israeli tanks surround the village without warning or explanation, everyone inside is cut off from the outside world. As the situation grows increasingly dire, the village devolves into a Darwinian jungle, where paranoia quickly takes hold and threatens the community's fragile equilibrium.<br><br>With the enduring moral and literary power of Camus and Orwell, <i>Let It Be Morning</i> offers an intimate, eye-opening portrait of the conflicted allegiances of the Israeli Arabs, proving once again that Sayed Kashua is a fearless, prophetic observer of a political and human quagmire that offers no easy answers.<br></p><p>Sayed Kashua was born in 1975 in the Galilee and now lives in Beit-Safafa, an Arab village within Jerusalem. He writes a column for the Ha&#x2019;aretz, Israel&#x2019;s most prestigious newspaper. His first novel, Dancing Arabs, was a San Francisco Chronicle Book of the Year.Adult/High School&#x2013;A young Arab-Israeli journalist moves from Tel Aviv back to his childhood village with his wife and baby daughter just in time to be caught up in a series of harrowing, dramatic events. In response to Israels military presence in the village, neighbors and relatives find themselves fighting one another in order to survive. The first-person narrative gives this novel the sort of immediacy often found in YA fiction; although the narrator is nearly 30, the short chapters and fast pace, combined with the memories of youth that his return home elicits, make for an easy fit for older teens with an interest in other cultures or current events. Some words or concepts are not explicitly defined, but are made clear in context. A real strength here is the unusual perspective; the novel relates the experience of those caught in the middle, the Arab-Israelis who are citizens but are separated from many of their countrymen by faith and heritage. The unspoken answer to the unnamed protagonists query about his own village: Who are they anyhow? is hinted at in the unsettling conclusion.

Originally published in 1854, this collection of fables was inspired by Louisa's time spent in the woods around Walden Pond&#x2015;a spot endearingly named "Fairyland" by Walden's own Henry David Thoreau. <br><br>Young Louisa collected these fairy fables into a volume dedicated to her friend Ellen Emerson, the daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. This volume&#x2015;published under the title, <i>Flower Fables</i>&#x2015;was Louisa's first published book. Applewood Books has partnered with Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House to publish this commemorative hardcover edition on the 150th anniversary of its first publication.</p><p>A talented group has been assembled to produce this edition. Daniel Shealy, the Alcott scholar who has edited the complete body of her fantasy fiction, contributes an illuminating afterward and is the book&#39;s editorial consultant. Leah Palmer Preiss&#39;s incomparable art suits the fresh and imaginative spirit of these pioneering tales. A playful facet of Preiss&#39;s exquisite illustrations is her inclusion of hidden quotes from and minuscule portraits of individuals who helped shape Alcott&#39;s life and work. Look closely and discover the words and faces of Shakespeare, Plato, Alcott&#39;s beloved mentors Emerson and Thoreau, and many more.For nearly 150 years, children around the world have cherished the stories and novels of Louisa May Alcott, including, of course, that most beloved classic <i>Little Women.</i> Surprisingly, there is a body of work by this American master not known to the general public, as it has not been widely published since her lifetime -- her fairy tales and fables. <p>These stories grew out of Alcott's experience, starting at the age of sixteen, as a teacher and storyteller to the children of her Concord, Massachusetts neighbors, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson. Alcott's imagination was nurtured by woodland walks with her friend Henry David Thoreau, including visits to his cabin on Walden Pond, and by the Transcendentalist philosophies of her father, Bronson Alcott. In this atmosphere she fashioned highly imaginative tales for her students. Encouraged by their spirited response, Alcott published six of her fairy tales under the title Flower Fables in 1854, marking the inception of her life as a pioneer in American fantasy fiction. </p><p>Indeed, it seemed a natural extension of Alcott's intellectual curiosity and love of nature to create a vibrant environment of possibility for children. Through these marvelously enticing encounters with fairies, elves, and animals, Alcott laid a foundation for young people based on the essential themes of love, kindness and responsibility.</p></p><h2>Sorry For My Familiar Vol. 3</h2><p><p><b>TRAPPED IN A GHOST TOWN!</b></p><p>Patty, Norman, and Lasanil have traveled to the Dragon Bone Islands in search of Patty's dad, but instead of finding him they bump into a figure from Norman's past!

Booty&#x2019;s edition of <i>The Book of Common Prayer, 1559, </i>first published by the University Press of Virginia for the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1976 and long out of print, is now being reissued in the same handsome format as the original edition. In her foreword to the 2005 reissue, Judith Maltby writes, "It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of the 1559 Prayer Book.... Shakespeare was clearly shaped by a culture in which the vernacular was remarkably vigorous."</p><p>Booty&#x2019;s text derives from a rare copy of the Elizabethan Prayer Book printed by Richard Jugge and John Cawode in 1559, now part of the Josiah Benton Collection of the Boston Public Library. Booty modernized spelling and punctuation, but took care not to distort the style and cadence of the Elizabethan text. To place the Prayer Book in its original cultural setting, he wrote a lengthy critical essay that traces the book&#x2019;s history and use during the sixteenth century. Helpful bibliographical notes enable readers to appreciate all the nuances of particular services and their contents. Particularly useful are the general index and the index of biblical passages, features unavailable in other editions of the Prayer Book.</p><p>Through this magnificent document one begins to understand not only the Anglican church but also the Elizabethan culture in which Shakespeare lived, for this was one of the books that helped shape Renaissance England in all of its vitality and greatness. As Booty reminds the reader in his preface, each Sunday "in the parish churches and in the cathedrals the nation was at prayer, the commonwealth was being realized, and God, in whose hands the destinies of all were lodged, was worshiped in spirit and in truth."</p><p>Published in association with the Folger Shakespeare Library</p></p><p><p>John E. Booty is Professor Emeritus of Church History at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Judith Maltby is Chaplain and Fellow at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.</p>W.H. Auden used to warn against those who read the Bible for its prose. Ignore this advice. The hoopla of the next few weeks should be interrupted from time to time with quiet moments when we reflect on our lives and the years past and to come, and one of the best ways to do this is by meditating on grave and noble sentences. So, whether believer or not, turn to the Gospel of Luke:<p>"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. . . . And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and lineage of David), to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."</p><p>As a boy, I would hear these words spoken aloud toward the end of December, year after year, and they never failed to deliver a shivery thrill of pleasure. I used to wonder why. The sentences were utterly plain, both in diction and syntax. Neither did they possess any narrative excitement, since I knew the story already, indeed knew it far better than any other in all the world. But the language -- like that of so many other passages from the Bible -- enchanted me with what I now think of as its deeply felt seriousness.</p><p>The solemn harmonies of such prose are largely ignored in these days of text-messaging and political newspeak. Even among our stylists, we prefer breeziness and irony, sometimes laced with snarky wit and street vulgarity. This "in your face" writing somehow feels personal and honest, more sincere or authentic than an elevated and poetical diction. No one wants epithets like "pontifical," "sermonizing" or "artificial" attached to his writing. Nonetheless, there are times when only the full organ roll of liturgical prose can match the glory or sacredness of the occasion. These are, of course, those times when we make our way to church or synagogue for weddings, funerals and religious holy days.</p><p>In English there are five main sources for this kind of religious eloquence: The King James version of the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer, The Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan, the hymns of writers like Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley and others, and the classical traditions of oratory and homily. What links them all is a Shaker plainness and cleanness of diction, just barely covering profound spiritual conviction and emotion. This is, in short, the speech of men and women doing the Lord's work, honoring him and praising him with due reverence, ceremony and fervor.</p><p>For instance, what soul doesn't feel, as well as hear, the sorrowful music in the Prayer Book's "Order for the Burial of the Dead"?</p><p>"Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower; he flieth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay. In the midst of life we be in death." I quote the 1559 Elizabethan version of these words, the version known to Shakespeare and the Renaissance (and now again available in a handsome volume, edited by John E. Booty, from the University of Virginia/Folger Shakespeare Library). These magnificently somber phrases eventually build to one of the great climaxes in English literature:</p><p>"Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, and that in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye by the last trump. For the trump shall blow, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed. . . . Death where is thy sting? Hell where is thy victory?" </p><p>To some readers, those last two emotion-filled questions may be better known from the final pages of The Pilgrim's Progress, when Mr. Valiant-for-Truth enters the river of death and pronounces the same words (though he substitutes "Grave" for "Hell"). As wonderful as they are, these phrases merely cap a farewell speech that would be right at home in Middle Earth: "I am going to my fathers," announces this battle-worn soldier of Christ, "and though with great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My sword, I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage and skill, to him that can get it. My marks and scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me that I have fought his battles who now will be my rewarder." Bunyan then concludes with positively Handelian grandeur: "So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side."</p><p>Theologically, the graceful moderation of the established Church of England was anathema to the ardently Puritan Bunyan. But, apart from the Old and New Testaments, no religious texts have more influenced the English-speaking imagination than the Book of Common Prayer and The Pilgrim's Progress. The simple beauty of the Prayer Book's prose, especially in its collects (generally thought to have been composed by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer), displays perfect pitch for sound and rhythmical balance:</p><p>"Almighty and most merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from thy ways, like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought to have done, and we have done those things which we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us."</p><p> Bunyan, in his turn, wrote what Bernard Shaw thought was the most perfect English, at once clear and forceful. Certainly his phrases and dramatis personae have passed into common parlance: "Fly from the wrath to come." "I have laid my hand to the plough." "The Slough of Despond." "The Giant Despair." "The Delectable Mountains." "Vanity-Fair." But besides the allegorical figures (Christian, Mr. Worldly-Wiseman), Bunyan also uses such surprisingly modern phrases as "spending money" and "Were you doers, or talkers only?"</p><p> And he ends Part One with a chilling sentence. Ignorance has arrived at the Celestial City and knocks on the door. So very close to his heavenly goal, he nonetheless lacks the proper "certificate" and is suddenly, unexpectedly damned, bound hand and foot, and thrust by angels through a door in the side of a hill. Writes Bunyan: "Then I saw that there was a way to Hell, even from the Gates of Heaven, as well as from the City of Destruction." On which harrowing note he brings his original vision to a close: "So I awoke, and behold, it was a Dream."</p><p>Such declamatory moments remind us that Bunyan passed much of his life, when not in prison, preaching in the open air. In our era of so much bland speech-making, we sometimes forget about this sheer power of oratory. Great preachers even now preserve its tradition, one in which human elocution alone, backed by passionate conviction and a desire to save souls, can bring people to tears, to their knees or to their feet. Think, for a supreme example, of Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p> The almost legendary 18th-century preacher George Whitefield was so magnificent a speaker that the atheist philosopher David Hume declared that he would travel 20 miles on foot to hear him. Once, every high-school student read, with growing terror, the rolling periods of Jonathan Edwards's sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God." After describing the horrors of the pit, he reminds us of the sharp precariousness of life:</p><p>"The bow of God's wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string, and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an angry God, without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood."</p><p>Our preachers grow most eloquent when describing hell-fire. But our hymns and carols sing of God's mercy and loving-kindness. Here the words tend to be simple and profoundly moving, a truly populist poetry. We cannot read them without the memory of many voices sounding forth on Sunday morning:</p><p>O God, our Help in ages past,<br>Our Hope for years to come,<br>Our Shelter from the stormy blast,<br>And our eternal Home<br> -- Isaac Watts </p><p> From H.F. Lyte's "Abide with me" and Blake's "Jerusalem" to "We Shall Overcome," these are the songs that see us through the hardest times. Like the Bible, Prayer Book and Bunyan, like the resounding voices of great preachers, they ask us to think about our lives and how we conduct them. It is good that we should do this. They feed what Philip Larkin called the hunger to be more serious that lies within each of us, even the agnostic. But at Christmas we should, above all, lift our hearts -- and voices -- in joy and hopefulness. In the words of Charles Wesley and George Whitefield:</p><p>Hark! the herald angels sing,<br>"Glory to the new-born King!<br>Peace on earth, and mercy mild,<br>God and sinners reconciled."<br>Above all, let us hope again this year, as every year, for peace on earth.</p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

Initially, we may take up contemplative practice as a means of tapping into the abundant resources of the mind and heart that bring serenity, but the meditative journey leads further&#x2015;to the place where wisdom and love unite. <br><br> In <i>Meditation as Contemplative Inquiry,</i> Arthur Zajonc offers an overview of the meditative life, weaving practical instruction together with the guidance and inspiration of the world&#x2019;s great teachers, from Rudolf Steiner to Rumi, and from Goethe to the sages of Asia. <br><br> Zajonc reminds us that an ethic of humility grounds all practice, and that care of the soul is the basis for sound spiritual reflection and understanding. The author carefully describes each stage of the path and includes many recommended practices. <br><br> <i>Meditation as Contemplative Inquiry</i> is the fruit of many years of personal practice and teaching. Arthur Zajonc developed his orientation toward meditation through working with hundreds of university students and professors, as well as with contemplative groups in the U.S., Europe, and Australia.</p><p><b>Arthur Zajonc</b>, Ph.D., is the Andrew Mellon professor of physics and interdisciplinary studies at Amherst College and is currently the director of the Academic Program of the Center for Contemplative Mind, an organization of 1500 academics supporting the appropriate inclusion of contemplative practice in higher education. Dr. Zajonc is the former General Secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in America, a cofounder of the Kira Institute, past President of the Lindisfarne Association, and a senior program director at the Fetzer Institute. He has served as scientific coordinator and editor for several dialogues with the Dalai Lama: <i>The New Physics and Cosmology,</i> held in 1997 and published in 2004, and &#x201c;The Nature of Matter, the Nature of Life&#x201d; (2002, unpublished). He was also moderator for the 2003 MIT dialogue, published as<i> The Dalai Lama at MIT </i>(2006). Dr. Zajonc is the author <i>Catching the Light</i> (1993, 1995), coauthor of<i> The Quantum Challenge</i> (2nd ed. 2005), and coeditor of <i>Goethe's Way of Science</i> (1998).<p></p><p></p>&#x201c;This book is an outstanding contribution to addressing a root issue of our time: how to integrate the quest for scientific clarity, contemplative awakening, and improved personal practices in a way that is clear, integrates Eastern and Western wisdom traditions, and offers readers practical methods and tools. It is highly recommended for those who want to deepen their personal foundations for profound change and presencing-based leadership work.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Otto Scharmer,</b> MIT, author of <i>Theory U: Leading from the Future as It Emerges</i> <br><br> <i>&#x201c;Mediation as Contemplative Inquiry</i> is a profound and masterful exposition of the calling, challenges, and, above all, the immediate and the harder-to-extract-but-worth-it gifts of meditative inquiry. Disciplining our unruly minds with marvelous exercises in attention and apperception that use all the senses and intelligences available to us, Arthur Zajonc employs his great skill as a teacher, his loving prose, and his razor-sharp intellect to guide us in the experience of a compassionate practice of knowing. Following his path, we can develop and bring to the fore the full dimensionality of our humanness, for ourselves and for others. A glistening gem of a book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Jon Kabat-Zinn,</b> author of <i>Coming to Our Senses</i> and <i>Arriving at Your Own Door</i> <br><br> &#x201c;The great turn needed to reverse problems like climate change and the growing gap between rich and poor is none other than the one that we can accomplish in our own ways of thinking and living together. I believe much of the discouragement and fear that pervades our world today comes from not seeing this connection between the outer circumstances of our world and our inner landscape. Once we have seen it, however, our core work becomes clear. We must bring our outer and inner change strategies into ever-greater alignment. Arthur Zajonc is one of our best guides in the new art of traversing the narrowing gulf between science, consciousness, and social change. This beautiful book embodies the best in his writing. He gives us simple and clear expositions of subtle concepts, touching evocations of timeless insights, and, above all meditative exercises that each of us can start practicing whenever we are ready.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Peter Senge,</b> author of <i>The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization</i> <br><br> &#x201c;In this beautifully written work, Arthur Zajonc, a seasoned meditator in the anthroposophical tradition, offers gentle and wise guidance on the path of contemplative inquiry.

Maintaining a European&#x2019;s detached gaze, he slowly comes to recognize the familiar stink of modernity that blows across the Windy City, the origins of whose greatness (the slaughterhouses, the railroads, the lumber and cereal-crop trades) are by now ancient history, and where what rears its head today is already scheduled for tomorrow&#x2019;s chopping block. Chicago has been the stage for some of modernity&#x2019;s key episodes: the birth of the skyscraper, the rise of urban sociology, the world&#x2019;s first atomic reactor, the hard-nosed monetarism of the Chicago School. Here in this postmodern Babel, where the contradictions of American society are writ large, d&#x2019;Eramo bears witness to the revolutionary, subversive power of capitalism at its purest.</p><p>Originally a physicist, <b>Marco d&#x2019;Eramo</b> studied sociology with Pierre Bourdieu in Paris.

Once a dirty word brushed away with a grimace, "feminist" has been rebranded as a shiny label sported by movie and pop stars, fashion designers, and multi-hyphenate powerhouses like Beyonc�. It drives advertising and marketing campaigns for everything from wireless plans to underwear to perfume, presenting what's long been a movement for social justice as just another consumer choice in a vast market. Individual self-actualization is the goal, shopping more often than not the means, and celebrities the mouthpieces.<br><br>But what does it mean when social change becomes a brand identity? Feminism's splashy arrival at the center of today's media and pop-culture marketplace, after all, hasn't offered solutions to the movement's unfinished business. Planned Parenthood is under sustained attack, women are still paid 77 percent-or less-of the man's dollar, and vicious attacks on women, both on- and offline, are utterly routine.<br><br>Andi Zeisler, a founding editor of Bitch Media, draws on more than twenty years' experience interpreting popular culture in this biting history of how feminism has been co-opted, watered down, and turned into a gyratory media trend. Surveying movies, television, advertising, fashion, and more, Zeisler reveals a media landscape brimming with the language of empowerment, but offering little in the way of transformational change. Witty, fearless, and unflinching, <em>We Were Feminists Once</em> is the story of how we let this happen, and how we can amplify feminism's real purpose and power.<br></p><p><b>Andi Zeisler</b> is a writer, editor, and cultural critic.

Douglas, award-winning author of <em>Where the Girls Are</em> and <em>Enlightened Sexism</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Zeisler's analysis of what she calls 'marketplace feminism' is acute and endlessly relevant, highlighting the insidiousness of the coopting powers that be, and calling on feminists to direct their resources toward legitimate political action and reclaim feminism as an identity, not something commodifiable.&#x201d; -<strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With delightfully dry wit, Zeisler carries the discussion of the portrayal of women in advertising, movies, television, and fashion both in the present day and recent history. ...This thought-provoking yet sobering consideration of the current state of feminism emphasizes the need to continue to fight for full equality.

Using scientific methods in his investigations of the human body &#x2014; the first ever by an artist &#x2014; he was able to create remarkably accurate depictions of the "ideal" figure.<br>This exceptional collection of 59 precise, detailed drawings reprints Leonardo's sketches, still considered the finest ever made, of the skeleton; vertebral column; skull; upper and lower extremities; cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems; human embryos; and other subjects. The volume will be a welcome addition to the libraries of artists, illustrators, and scientists.</p><p>One of the great geniuses of Western civilization, Leonardo da Vinci (1452&#x2013;1519) is the true Renaissance man. In addition to his abundant artistic skills, he was a visionary scientist and mechanical engineer who theorized the development of flying machines and solar power.</p><h2>Duchamp&#39;s Last Day (ekphrasis)</h2><p>Published on the fiftieth anniversary of Marcel Duchamp&#x2019;s death, Duchamp&#x2019;s Last Day offers a radical reading of the artist&#x2019;s final hours. Just moments after Duchamp died, his closest friend Man Ray took a photograph of him. His face is wan; his eyes are closed; he appears calm. Taking this image as a point of departure, Donald Shambroom begins to examine the surrounding context&#x2014;the dinner with Man Ray and another friend, Robert Lebel, the night Duchamp died, the conversations about his own death at that dinner and elsewhere, and the larger question of whether this radical artist&#x2019;s death can be read as an extension of his work. Shambroom&#x2019;s in-depth research into this final night, and his analysis of the photograph, feeds into larger questions about the very nature of artworks and authorship which Duchamp raised in his lifetime. In the case of this mysterious and once long-lost photograph, who is the author? Man Ray or Duchamp? Is it an artwork or merely a record? Has the artist himself turned into one of his own readymades? A fascinating essay that is both intimate and steeped in art history, Duchamp&#x2019;s Last Day is filled with intricate details from decades of research into this peculiar encounter between art, life, and death. Shambroom&#x2019;s book is a wonderful study of one of the greatest artists of the twentieth century.</p><p>Donald Shambroom is a visual artist, writer, curator, and videographer whose work is in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 1973, after graduating from Yale University where he studied philosophy and painting, Shambroom moved to Boston to pursue his career as a painter. Shambroom&#x2019;s interest in Marcel Duchamp began in 1969, when he read Calvin Tomkins&#x2019;s The World of Marcel Duchamp in highschool. His essays have appeared in Weltkunst (Duchamp&#x2019;s Last Readymade, 2014), CFile (A Urinal Called Fountain, 2017), and Tout-Fait (Marcel Duchamp and Glass, 1999 and Leonardo&#x2019;s Optics Through the Eyes of Duchamp: A Note on the Small Glass, 2000). He produced &#x201c;Common Screech Owl, a Miller&#x2019;s River Story&#x201d; (2013), a multi-media natural history installation, and &#x201c;The Garnet Cabinet&#x201d; (2012), a meditation on crystal structure. Shambroom&#x2019;s work has been shown at Francis Naumann gallery and Half Gallery in New York, and at Howard Yezerski Gallery in Boston. For the past decade, he has lived and worked on the banks of the Millers River in north central Massachusetts.Duchamp&#x2019;s Last Day is a bravo performance capturing the ephemerality of life and the physicality of art.

He also examines how China sought to maintain a presence in Tibet, so that whenever the Great Game ended, Chinese influence would reign supreme. This presence culminated in the Chinese invasion of Tibet in the 1950s, and in a brief afterword, Hopkirk updates his compelling account of "the gatecrashers of Tibet" with a discussion of Tibet today&#x2014;as a property still claimed and annexed by the Chinese.</p><p><b>PETER HOPKIRK</b> is the author of Like Hidden Fire: The Plot to Bring Down the British Empire, <i>Trespassers on the Roof of the World</i>: The Race for Lhasa, and two other books.

His visionary directing has created some of the most influential productions in contemporary theater. Now at the pinnacle of his career, Brook has given us his memoir, a luminous, inspiring work in which he reflects on his artistic fortunes, his idols and teachers, his philosophical path and personal journey. In this autobiography, the man &#39;The New York Times&#39; has called &#34;the English-speaking world&#39;s most eminent director&#34; and &#39;The London Times&#39; has named &#34;theater&#39;s living legend&#34; reveals the myriad sources behind his lifelong passion to find the most expressive way of telling a story. Whether in India&#39;s epic &#34;Mahabharata&#34; or a stage adaptation of Oliver Sak&#39;s &#34;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,&#34; South Africa&#39;s&#34; Woza Albert&#34; or &#34;The Cherry Orchard,&#34; Brook&#39;s unique blend of practicality and vision creates unforgettable experiences for audiences worldwide.</p><p>When the 18-year-old, self-taught director Peter Brook brought his first play to the London stage he inaugurated a long and illustrious career. Perhaps best known for his London production of the play <i>Marat/Sade</i> and the nine-hour stage epic <i>Mahabharata</i>, Brook also directs film--<i>Lord of the Flies</i> is his best-known movie--and opera. In his uncommon autobiography, he assiduously avoids "personal relationships, indiscretions, indulgences, excesses, names of close friends, private angers" as well as "taboos [and] hang-ups." Instead, Brook focuses on the development of his artistic vision, his philosophical leanings and his quest for meaning in both of these areas. With <i>Threads of Time</i>, Brook proves that he is also a talented writer for he pulls together the strands of his experience and ideas to offer readers an evocative view of his fascinating life.Peter Brook received his M.A. at Oxford, where he founded the Oxford University Film Society. A former codirector of the Royal Shakespeare Company, he currently heads the International Centre of Theatre Research, which he founded in Paris in 1971. He has directed more than fifty productions, and his films include the original Lord of the Flies.

American intelligence played a key role in gathering information on the political and military situation in Vietnam and on the strengths and weaknesses of both sides. But as George Allen shows in this eye-popping memoir, intelligence appraisals were consistently ignored or rejected by policymakers in every administration from Eisenhower through Nixon&#x2015;because these assessments undermined the mistaken assumptions of the White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon. From his vantage point as a chief official with the CIA and army intelligence, Mr. Allen reveals specifically how American leaders, unwilling to face up to &#x201c;bad news&#x201d; from intelligence sources, largely excluded intelligence from important policy deliberations until it was too late. <i>None So Blind</i> is a remarkable contribution to the history of the Vietnam War.</p><p>George W. Allen was from 1949 to 1979 an intelligence analyst for the army, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the CIA. He specialized in the Vietnam wars, served almost three years in Vietnam itself, and later held senior staff and management positions related to the production of strategic intelligence. He lives in Williamsburg, Virginia.Few Americans knew more about the inner workings of American Vietnam War policy over as long a period of time as Allen did. A WWII navy veteran, Allen went to work as a midlevel civilian defense department intelligence analyst after the war. In 1964, he switched to the CIA, where he served in a similar capacity until his 1979 retirement. Allen spent virtually all of that time in Vietnam and Washington compiling firsthand intelligence about the French and American wars; he tells (what seems like) all in this wide-ranging, illuminating memoir. One message shines through this recounting of more than three decades of American policy-making in Vietnam, what Allen calls the "unwillingness of U.S. officials to confront reality in Vietnam." Allen names the names of those officials. They included the three top Army generals sent to South Vietnam in the 1950s and early 1960s (Joseph "Lightning Joe" Collins, Samuel T. "Hanging Sam" Williams and Paul Harkins); the ambassador to South Vietnam in 1964-1965, Maxwell Taylor; and Johnson administration heavies Walt Rostow, McGeorge and William Bundy and Robert S. McNamara. Those men and many others preferred to make their own strategic and tactical decisions, nearly all of which were doomed. Allen makes a strong case that the "failure" of the book's subtitle was not one of misreported or incorrect analysis; it was of not being able to convince the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson or Nixon administrations that they were pursuing the wrong course in the Vietnam War. (Sept. 14) Forecast: While this is not the less technical analysis most lay readers will want, historians and other pundits will add it to their arsenals in the continuing re-evaluation of the war and its aging and departed players. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Peter, Paul &amp; Mary Songbook</h2><p>(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Artist Songbook).

Charlton's analysis is illuminated by interviews he conducted over a ten-year period with disability rights activists throughout the Third World, Europe, and the United States.<br><br> Charlton finds an antidote for dependency and powerlessness in the resistance to disability oppression that is emerging worldwide. His interviews contain striking stories of self-reliance and empowerment evoking the new consciousness of disability rights activists. As a latecomer among the world's liberation movements, the disability rights movement will gain visibility and momentum from Charlton's elucidation of its history and its political philosophy of self-determination, which is captured in the title of his book.<br><br> <i>Nothing About Us Without Us</i> expresses the conviction of people with disabilities that they know what is best for them. Charlton's combination of personal involvement and theoretical awareness assures greater understanding of the disability rights movement.</p><p>"Jim Charlton in a deeply moving work demolishes old myths about disabilities. He reveals in stunning oral histories, conducted in ten diferent countries, possibilities yet untapped."&#x2015;Studs Terkel<br><br>"A defining document in the literature of disability culture. Jim Charlton chronicles both the history and experience of exclusion so familiar to people with disabilities. But he does it all in a style and with a sensitivity that connects the voices of a unique community to the universal narrative of human rights. This is oral history and political manifesto rich with wisdom and insight on every page."&#x2015;John Hockenberry<br><br>"A powerful framing of the question of disability rights [from] an international human rights perspective. . . .

The book has been split into two volumes: the first, covering the period 1300 to 1510; the second, 1490 to 1600. The volumes retain the same innovative decade-by-decade structure as the first edition, and a number of chapters have been revised by the authors to reflect the latest scholarship. The coverage of the Trecento has been expanded, and a new appendix section explains all the key Renaissance art-making techniques, with illustrations and step-by-steps for such processes as lost-wax casting. This book tells the story of art in the great cities of Rome, Florence, and Venice while profiling a range of other centers throughout Italy&#x2015;including in this edition art from Naples, Padua, and Palermo.&nbsp; 836 illustrations, 722 in color</p><p><p><b>Stephen J.

Resting in its depths lie the lost ships of war, spanning the totality of human history. Many wrecks are nameless, others from more recent times are remembered, honored even, as are the battles that claimed them, like Actium, Trafalgar, Tsushima, Jutland, Pearl Harbor, and Midway. Underwater exploration is increasingly discovering long-lost warships from the deepest parts of the ocean, revealing a vast undersea museum that speaks to battles won and lost, service, sacrifice, and the human costs of warfare. <br><br><em>War at Sea</em> is a dramatic global tour of this remote museum and other formerly lost traces of humanity's naval heritage. It is also an account by the world's leading naval archaeologist of how underwater exploration has discovered these remains, thus resolving mysteries, adding to our understanding of the past, and providing intimate details of the experience of naval warfare. Arranged chronologically, the book begins with the warships and battles of the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and Chinese, and then progresses through three thousand years to the lost ships of the Cold War.<br><br>James Delgado, who has personally explored, dived, and studied a number of the wrecks and sites in the book, provides insights as an explorer, archaeologist, and storyteller. The result is a unique and compelling history of naval warfare. From fallen triremes and galleons to dreadnoughts, aircraft carriers, and nuclear submarines, this book vividly brings thousands of years of naval warfare to life.<br></p><p><br><strong>James P. Delgado </strong>is a maritime archaeologist, explorer, and author. His shipwreck investigations include the RMS Titanic, USS Monitor, USS Arizona (BB-39), Sub Marine Explorer, the buried Gold Rush ships of San Francisco, and Kublai Khan's legendary lost fleet.<br><br>"In WAR AT SEA, James P. Delgado delivers a sweeping history of naval warfare told through the evidence of sunken ships scattered around the globe . . . readers may wish to know more of Mr. Delgado's personal experience, given the hints he offers of his own shipwreck searches. Having written a highly readable survey of naval warfare and technology, he clearly has more stories to tell." <br>- THE WALL STREET JOURNAL <br><p></p><br>"Awe-inspiring." <br>-FOREWORD REVIEWS<p></p><br>"A detailed and well-documented global tour of the history of lost warships over 3,000 years of prehistory and history . . . an incredible piece of research by <br>one of the pioneers of underwater cultural studies . . . a masterpiece that <br>will be a benchmark for understanding the significance of shipwreck <br>history for decades to come." <br>- THE NAVAL HISTORICAL FOUNDATION <br><p></p><br>"James Delgado is the Sherlock Holmes of sunken warship investigation, perhaps the most respected and renowned military marine archeological expert of all time. Fascinating and dramatic, <em>War at Sea</em> is his most recent book, a treasury of intrigue and enigmas from the countless sunken warships that lie on the bottom of oceans, lakes, and rivers. --Clive Cussler, bestselling novelist and founder of the National Underwater and Marine Agency<p></p><br>"There is no finer maritime historian alive today than James Delgado. His new book <em>War at Sea</em> is a stunning example of his broad knowledge of all times historical beneath the sea.

Ballard, discoverer of the RMS Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck<p></p><br>"Compelling and captivating. A real <em>tour de force.</em> Delgado takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the history of warships from antiquity to the present, focusing especially on the relevant shipwrecks and fragmentary remains that have been recovered by maritime archaeologists. Magisterial."--Eric Cline, author of <em>1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed</em><p></p><br>"Combining vast, up-to-the-minute scholarship with his extensive personal experience exploring the shipwrecks of the world, James Delgado has created an encyclopedic history of war at sea that is also a fun and fascinating read.

He provides a complete tour of ailments and folk treatments organized by body systems, as well as information on medicinal plants, patent medicines, and magico-religious beliefs and practices. He investigates folk healers and their methods, profiling three living practitioners: an herbalist, a faith healer, and a Native American healer. The book also includes an appendix of botanicals and a glossary of folk medical terms.<br><br>Demonstrating the ongoing interplay between mainstream scientific medicine and folk medicine, Cavender challenges the conventional view of southern Appalachia as an exceptional region isolated from outside contact. His thorough and accessible study reveals how Appalachian folk medicine encompasses such diverse and important influences as European and Native American culture and America's changing medical and health-care environment. In doing so, he offers a compelling representation of the cultural history of the region as seen through its health practices.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Folk Medicine in Southern Appalachia</i> is a text that will surely be read widely among the academic community interested in regional and medical anthropology study, but it is a book that could just [as] well be enjoyed by someone whose interest in Southern Appalachian folk medicine and mythology was sparked by reading Charles Frazier's <i>Cold Mountain</i>, or by a vague memory of a remedy that grandma once used. . . . If you are intrigued at the thought of mentally transporting yourself to a long-ago-cabin filled with dried herbs and magic, find a copy of <i>Folk Medicine in Southern Appalachia</i> and fill your head with tales of folk medicine and a regional history of healing."-- <i>The Mountain Times</i> <br>Anthony Cavender is professor of anthropology at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City.

This comprehensive resource provides strategies and solutions for many employment challenges and will be an asset in any professional development curriculum.</p><p><i>Marilyn Rosee</i> and <i>Lisa Davis</i>, both occupational therapists, came together in 1985 with an idea. Working together as per diem therapists for a group of nursing homes, they found there were many requests for their services, but only so many hours in the day. Combining their entrepreneurial spirit and skills as occupational therapists, they decided to start their own agency, hiring therapists to work directly for them and placing them in the positions they could not accept themselves. They thought their chances for success were slim, but they decided to try anyway. They named their business Therapeutic Resources.<br> Before embarking on the new venture, Lisa, a graduate of New York University&#x2019;s graduate program in occupational therapy, was serving as Director of Occupational Therapy at Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center in New York. Marilyn, a graduate of Columbia University&#x2019;s graduate program in occupational therapy, was a Senior Therapist at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. While attending New York University, pursuing a Master of Public Administration in Health Administration, Marilyn was inspired to pursue a nontraditional career path in occupational therapy. Searching for a viable business concept where her talents as an occupational therapist could be utilized, she jumped at the opportunity to work with Lisa to develop their idea to create a rehabilitation staffing agency<br> After joining together, Lisa and Marilyn continued their full-time consulting positions while spending evenings and weekends interviewing therapists, planning marketing campaigns, and performing bookkeeping tasks. Gradually, their business grew and they were able to afford to rent an office and hire an office manager to help with administrative responsibilities. As each year passed, their staff grew along with their business. Now, almost three decades later, they look at each other across their &#x201c;partners&#x201d; desk, enjoy their panoramic view of New York City, and marvel at what they have accomplished as they work together with their office staff to continue their mission. In addition to the hundreds of facilities and municipalities they serve and the respect they enjoy from the therapy community, they are especially proud of their continuing education division, which provides cutting-edge programs for occupational and physical therapists, speech and language pathologists and special educators.<br> Through it all, Marilyn and Lisa have proudly maintained their identities as &#x201c;working&#x201d; occupational therapists through their varied professional positions, including managing a multi-facility rehab department, directing rehabilitation and occupational therapy departments, as well as performing hands-on provision of therapy with pediatric populations. Additionally, they have taught in occupational therapy programs, serving as Adjunct Professors at New York University, Long Island University, Touro College, New York Institute of Technology, and LaGuardia Community College. They have lectured extensively over the years on topics relating to private practice, long-term care management, and most recently, to the skills needed to make a successful transition from student to clinician. They have served as Board Members at the New York State Occupational Therapy District of the New York State Occupational Therapy Association, as well as serving as Co-Chairs of the Geriatric Special Interest Group and the Continuing Education Committee. All of their experiences contributed to the development of this book.<br> After all these years, Marilyn and Lisa look back with pride at what they have accomplished together and the friendship they have forged.<br>&#x201c;This is a wonderful reference for novice occupational therapists, but students embarking on fieldwork also would find it a valuable resource. The authors provide an excellent compilation of information with concrete details. This is a book that all fieldwork students should read before beginning level II fieldwork!&#x201d;<br><br> -Yvonne M. Randall, EdD, OTR/L, FAOTA, <i>Touro University Nevada, Doody&#x2019;s Review Service</i></p><h2>The Ethics of Invention: Technology and the Human Future</h2><p><p><strong>We live in a world increasingly governed by technology&#x2015;but to what end?</strong></p><p>Technology rules us as much as laws do. It shapes the legal, social, and ethical environments in which we act. Every time we cross a street, drive a car, or go to the doctor, we submit to the silent power of technology. Yet, much of the time, the influence of technology on our lives goes unchallenged by citizens and our elected representatives. In <em>The Ethics of Invention</em>, renowned scholar Sheila Jasanoff dissects the ways in which we delegate power to technological systems and asks how we might regain control.</p><p>Our embrace of novel technological pathways, Jasanoff shows, leads to a complex interplay among technology, ethics, and human rights. Inventions like pesticides or GMOs can reduce hunger but can also cause unexpected harm to people and the environment. Often, as in the case of CFCs creating a hole in the ozone layer, it takes decades before we even realize that any damage has been done. Advances in biotechnology, from GMOs to gene editing, have given us tools to tinker with life itself, leading some to worry that human dignity and even human nature are under threat. But despite many reasons for caution, we continue to march heedlessly into ethically troubled waters.</p><p>As Jasanoff ranges across these and other themes, she challenges the common assumption that technology is an apolitical and amoral force. Technology, she masterfully demonstrates, can warp the meaning of democracy and citizenship unless we carefully consider how to direct its power rather than let ourselves be shaped by it. <em>The Ethics of Invention</em> makes a bold argument for a future in which societies work together&#x2015;in open, democratic dialogue&#x2015;to debate not only the perils but even more the promises of technology.</p></p><p>Sheila Jasanoff is professor of science and technology studies at Harvard Kennedy School. She is the author of many books on technology, most recently Science and Public Reason and Designs on Nature. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&#x201c;Jasanoff argues for an entirely new body of ethical discourse, going beyond technical risk assessment to give due weight to economic, cultural, social and religious perspectives. . . . Jasanoff thoughtfully discusses the limits of conventional risk analysis, with its biases in favour of innovation and quantification. . . . The book helps to pinpoint recurring patterns in contemporary technological debates and to frame what is at stake in their outcomes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven Aftergood, <em>Nature</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Impressively spanning advances in biomedicine, information technology, and green biotechnology, Jasanoff deftly draws out the social and political dramas of technological systems in a series of case studies, revealing how we attempt to steer new science and technology to create more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous societies. Jasanoff&#x2019;s engaging prose brings essential and thoughtful attention to questions of justice, the limits of expert prediction, and the unwieldiness of responsibility in the 21st century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cynthia Selin, <em>Science</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A remarkable book which brings government and technology into much-needed dialogue. Across disasters and designer babies, GMO crops and information technologies, Sheila Jasanoff expertly tracks the social and technological forces that shape our worlds. Drawing on the full range of her previous scholarship, she elegantly raises a number of profound questions concerning the possibilities for democratic control over technological forces which seem too fast, too complex and too unpredictable for our institutions to handle. Along the way, our very notion of democracy is extended, challenged and transformed.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Professor Alan Irwin, Department of Organization, Copenhagen Business School</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Not bewitched by technological promises, <em>The Ethics of Invention</em> reclaims the future for human creativity. Sheila Jasanoff opens our eyes to the fact that societies are governed by technical systems as much as by the rule of law. And if we want to govern ourselves well, we need collective imaginations of the world we want to live in.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Professor Alfred Nordmann, Darmstadt Technical University</strong></p><h2>Doing Good: Passion and Commitment for Helping Others (Accelerated Development)</h2><p>This text is intended to inspire people to make a difference in their work.

Now, to mark the centenary of this epochal event, historian Steve Smith presents a panoramic account of the history of the Russian empire, from the last years of the nineteenth century to the end of the 1920s when Stalin unleashed violent collectivization of agriculture and crash industrialization upon Russian society. <br><br>Drawing on recent archival scholarship, <em>Russia in Revolution</em> pays particular attention to the varying impact of the Revolution on different social groups including peasants, workers, non-Russian nationals, the army, women, young people, and the Church. The book provides a fresh approach toward the big, perennial questions about the Revolution and its consequences. Why did the tsarist government's attempt to implement political reform after the 1905 Revolution fail? Why did the First World War bring about the collapse of the tsarist system? Why did the attempt to create a democratic system after the February Revolution of 1917 never get off the ground? Why did the Bolsheviks succeeded in seizing power? Why did Stalin come out on top in the power struggle inside the Bolshevik party after Lenin's death in 1924? <br><br>A final chapter reflects on the larger significance of 1917 for the history of the twentieth century and, for all its terrible flaws, what the promise of the Revolution might mean for us today.<br></p><p><br><strong>S. A. Smith</strong> is a historian of modern Russia and China, who was a graduate student at both Moscow State University and at Peking University.

Both men have devoted most of their scholarly lives to studying the revolution. They bring to their current works not just vast knowledge but also a deep commitment to balanced judgment, intellectual rigour and honesty, and accessible writing."--Dominic Lieven, <em>Financial Times</em> <br><p></p><br>"A challenging revisionist history reassessing the ongoing significance of the Russian Revolution Smith's work will be declared a subject standard, sure to stand out for its stellar research."--<em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"A master historian of the Russian Revolution, S.A. Smith has wrestled the events and personalities, policies and mass politics of the years 1890 to 1928 into a coherent and compelling story of the entrance of ordinary people onto the stage of history and the brutal, violent descent of Russia into dictatorship. Smith explains better than anyone else how a revolution marked by radical democracy and hope for social justice sacrificed many of its ideals to win and hold power and inspire an international movement against capitalism and imperialism."--Ronald Grigor Suny, Distinguished University Professor of History and Political Science, University of Michigan <br><p></p><br>"Readers looking for an introduction to the deep roots of the revolution, its proximate causes and aftermath are well served by S.A. Smith's <em>Russia in Revolution.</em> Smith looks at the social and political contexts, especially the failure of an earlier revolution in 1905, which led to political stagnation and crackdowns."--<em>Korea Herald</em> <br><p></p><br>"A broader, contextual understanding of the revolution, from its causes to its legacy, can be gleaned from the pages of Smith's <em>Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis, 1890 to 1928.</em> The Oxford historian, whose intended audience is readers coming new to the subject, delivers a clear, thorough, approachable primer. The book's illuminating coverage of life in Russia during the early 1920s details the brief but influential flourishing of artistic experimentation that fostered such enduring figures as filmmakers Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov, painters Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky, theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold, poet Anna Akhmatova and many others."--<em>The Globe and Mail</em> <br><p></p><br>"Smith is the most sympathetic to emancipatory politics, and it offers the most persuasive explanation of the Russian Revolution's origins and terrible failures. Smith's approach to history, with an emphasis on long-term factors and the experience of ordinary people, also feels the most relevant to our own historical moment. As in the early 20th century, we are living in an age in which mass movements and popular fury have a new currency."--<em>The Nation</em> <br><p></p><br>"It is the most expansive history of the 1917 revolution available. Smith traces the revolution in detail, as well as its prelude and aftermath.

Stevenson has collected over 2,600 reported cases of past-life memories of which 65 detailed reports have been published. Specific information from the children's memories has been collected and matched with the data of their claimed former identity, family, residence, and manner of death. Birthmarks or other physiological manifestations have been found to relate to experiences of the remembered past life, particularly violent death. Writing as a specialist in psychiatry and as a world-renowned scientific investigator of reported paranormal events, Stevenson asks us to suspend our Western tendencies to disbelieve in reincarnation and consider the reality of the burgeoning record of cases now available. This book summarizes Stevenson's findings which are presented in full in the multi-volume work entitled <i>Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects</i>, also published by Praeger.</p></p><p><p>Examines childhood memories of past lives in relation to physiological markings or abnormalities associated with past life experiences.</p><p>IAN STEVENSON is Carlson Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Personality Studies at the Health Sciences Center, University of Virginia.

Drs. Allan Zuckoff and Bonnie Gorscak understand. That's why this book is different. Whether it's breaking an unhealthy habit, pursuing that dream job, or ending harmful patterns in relationships, the key to moving ahead with your life lies in discovering what direction is truly right for <i>you</i>, and how you can get there. The proven counseling approach known as motivational interviewing (MI) can help. Drs. Zuckoff and Gorscak present powerful self-help strategies and practical tools that help you understand why you're stuck, break free of unhelpful pressure to change, and build confidence for developing a personal change plan. Vivid stories of five men and women confronting different types of challenges illustrate the techniques and accompany you on your journey. MI has a track record of helping people resolve long-standing dilemmas in a remarkably short time. Now you can try it for yourself--and unlock your own capacity for positive action.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Allan Zuckoff, PhD, is a psychologist who conducts professional training in MI throughout the United States and internationally. He also develops new applications of MI for people facing a variety of personal challenges and life issues. Dr. Zuckoff is a member of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT). After two decades as a faculty member in the Departments of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, he now oversees clinical program development at Vital Decisions, which provides MI-based advance care planning services to people with life-limiting illnesses.<br><br> Bonnie Gorscak, PhD, is a psychologist and MI practitioner who has worked in the mental health field for 30 years."This brilliant book guides you through a journey of discovery in that most intimate and difficult relationship--the one with yourself. Stories of others who have made the trek illustrate the challenges of being stuck in a problem that seems intractable, the way through the mire, and the joy of emerging on the other side. The book offers not only the promise of change, but also the ability to sustain it."--David B. Rosengren, PhD, Prevention Research Institute<br><br> "Changing our behaviors is a journey with lots of twists and turns. Including compassionate stories of people facing different challenges and problems, this book guides you to deal with ambivalence, find confidence, overcome false starts, handle well-meaning advice and nagging, and make personally meaningful decisions and plans. It provides great tools for achieving and sustaining changes in your life."--Carlo C. DiClemente, PhD, ABPP, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Changing for Good</i><br><br> "If you've ever said to yourself, 'I really want to change, but I just can't seem to do it,' you need to read this excellent book. Dr. Zuckoff knows that there are powerful forces within us that can sabotage our good intentions and best-laid plans. He gives you practical, scientifically grounded tools to help you understand why you're spinning your wheels and how to productively work through it."--Henny Westra, PhD, CPsych, Department of Psychology, York University, Canada<br><br> "A friend suggested that I read this book when she learned I was considering a career change. It provided me with a useful toolkit for considering what I want to do next, based on my own deep-seated interests and visions of my professional life. The concepts and techniques are easy to grasp. Previously, I tried to make difficult decisions by listing the pros and cons--this book offers a more sophisticated and thoughtful approach."--John F.<br><br> "A lucid roadmap for those struggling to make changes in their lives, this book uses a scientifically proven approach to help you move forward from feeling stuck to creating a plan of action. Written exercises encourage reflection and self-discovery and help you explore your ambivalence, goals, and dilemmas. Superb examples of five easy-to-relate-to people making important changes accompany you through the process."--Holly A. Swartz, MD, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine<br><br> &#x201c;This book is a compassionate companion that helps you draw on your strengths and proceed at your own pace to unlock your capacity for change. It provides a nonjudgmental, step-by-step approach that can lead you to take brave new actions that fulfill your needs."--Nancy K. Grote, PhD, School of Social Work, University of Washington<br><br> "Plenty of self-help books offer great ideas about how to make changes, but most are missing the most obvious and important ingredient--intrinsic motivation. Decades of research have proven that if we are not internally motivated to change, all the help in the world won't make a difference. Dr. Zuckoff provides the missing link in the world of personal growth. This book is a gem."--Joel Porter, PsyD, Clinical Director, Lives Lived Well, Brisbane, Australia; member, Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT)<br><br> "I am thrilled that MI is now readily accessible to all in a practical, step-by-step format. The book reminds us that the most powerful force for change resides within each of us, and uses thought-provoking exercises to unleash this power. For anyone facing a difficult decision or need for personal change, this book offers a way forward."--Sandy Downey, MS, LPC, psychotherapist, Harrisonburg, Virginia<br><br> "This book is designed to help you get unstuck from ambivalence and move ahead with positive changes you might choose to make in your life....The authors do not dispense quick tricks or promise to give you something that you lack.&nbsp; Rather they help you find that which you already have within you and draw out your own motivations for and wisdom about change. Change in the face of ambivalence is a very common human predicament. We applaud the authors for translating the science and practice of MI into a useful skills-based book for anyone who wants to find his or her way to change."--from the Foreword by William R. Miller, PhD, and Stephen Rollnick, PhD<br>&nbsp;"The method in this book can fuel the fire of change and help you move from despair to positive action. The exercises are wonderful. The book helped me think differently about a dilemma in my own life, and I found myself reading parts of it to a friend who came to me for advice."--Theresa B.

In this pioneering account, a distinguished aeronautical scientist presents a history of fluid mechanics focusing on the achievements of the pioneering scientists and thinkers whose inspirations and experiments lay behind the evolution of such disparate devices as irrigation lifts, ocean liners, windmills, fireworks and spacecraft.<br>The author first presents the basics of fluid mechanics, then explores the advances made through the work of such gifted thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, da Vinci, Galileo, Pascal, Newton, Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, Ernst Mach and other scientists of the 20th century. Especially important for its illuminating comparison of the development of fluid mechanics in the former Soviet Union with that in the West, the book concludes with studies of transsonic compressibility and aerodynamics, supersonic fluid mechanics, hypersonic gas dynamics and the universal matter-energy continuity. <br>Professor G.

The final two chapters discuss internal and external environmental factors relevant to collection care, including storage, condition reporting, crating, and transport. One key contribution of this book is its many photos, which provide a visual reference for handling techniques and apparatuses. Such a generously illustrated reference work is rare and extremely useful. The volume concludes with an extensive 'References and Resources' section, which guides readers to more detailed information on all the topics covered in the book. Overall, Collection Care is a unique and important addition to the literature, and suitable for all collections supporting museum studies and operations. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Upper-level undergraduates through researchers/faculty; professionals/practitioners. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Many books address collection care, but they tend to be written by specialists for specialists. Thus, they are inclined to be narrowly focused and too often beyond the grasp of a generalist seeking a broad understanding of collection care. Brent Powell&#x2019;s book is an exception, aimed to educate a wide range of individuals. Anyone who manages a collection, or puts on a pair of gloves to move a small bronze, or packs a large sculpture for shipment overseas, should profit from reading Collection Care: An Illustrated Handbook for the Care and Handling of Cultural Objects.

He demonstrates this system's success, beginning in the 1820s and 1830s, in confining sectional disputes safely within the political arena. With the breakdown of vital two-party competition in the 1850s, sectional issues increasingly took on ideological dimension, causing, Americans North and South to see in them dangerous threats to cherished republican institutions. No longer manageable within the arena of politics, sectional differences had to be resolved with in the arena of battle.</p><p><em>The Political Crisis of the 1850s</em> offers a clearly written account of politics (state and federal), sectionalism, race, and slavery from the 1820s through to the Civil War, brilliantly combining the behavioral and ideological approaches to political history.</p></p><p>Michael F.

Her mother kept Giselle, a young Air Master still growing into her abilities, isolated for the sake of herself and others. <br> &nbsp;<br> This life left her unprepared when a handsome young man appeared at the base of her tower. But when the young stranger entered her window, he tried to force himself on her. She was saved by Mother, an Earth Master, who hurled the man out the window he had climbed in. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Foresters of the Black Forest were Earth Masters whose job it was to cleanse the ancient forest of evil elementals, and over the next four years, they shared their fighting expertise to teach Giselle self-defense. By the age of twenty, Giselle was an expert markswoman, and it was this skill that she used to survive when Mother died. Cutting her long hair, she masqueraded as a boy to enter shooting competitions, and used the prize money to support herself. <br> &nbsp;<br> But she could not forget the first man who assaulted her, for when that stranger had fallen from her tower long ago, his body had never been found. In Giselle&#x2019;s heart, she was certain his magic had helped him to survive the fall. Surely, it was only a matter of time before he found her and sought revenge. Was she prepared to stand against him?</p><p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b>&nbsp;is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling Heralds of Valdemar series.

Turn around. Let me look you in the eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>Still on his knees in the cold earth, he slowly turned.</p><p>Behind him, her face clear in the moonlight, was a tall, hawk-faced woman in a long black cloak, her dark hair severely braided and pinned tightly around her face. She had her arms crossed over her chest and stared down at him icily. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; she prompted. &#x201c;What sort of fairy tale have you to tell me?&#x201d;</p><p>He opened and shut his mouth several times without any words coming out. But then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his panic got the better of him, and he fell apart.</p><p>He groveled. He babbled. He wept without hope that he would get even a crumb of pity from her. He really didn&#x2019;t know what he was saying, although he certainly went on at length about Maria and the children. He begged and pleaded, he cried shamelessly until he was hoarse. She said nothing. And finally, when he had repeated himself far too many times and ran out of words, she stared down at him in the silence while he waited helplessly for her to set the dogs on him, call for the police, or both.</p><p><i>I am going to be savaged. Then I am going to prison. Maria will die, and the children will starve.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;I am actually inclined to believe you.&#x201d; She looked down at him for another long, cold moment. &#x201c;And I am not an unreasonable woman, nor am I inclined to make your children suffer for your sins. It is clear that they will probably all starve without you to provide for them. I would not care to have the deaths of children on my conscience. Perhaps I can think of some way you can repay what you stole.&#x201d;</p><p>He began to have faint hope. Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps she would let him go? He looked up at her and clasped his hands under his chin, trying to look as prayerful and repentant as possible. &#x201c;Anything!&#x201d; he blurted.</p><p>But she was not finished. &#x201c;A bargain, then. You owe me, Friedrich Schnittel. You owe me a very great deal. But I won&#x2019;t have you thrown in prison. In fact, you can come here and gather what you need for your family every day, on condition that you repay me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;H&#x2014;&#x201d; he did not even manage to get all of the word <i>how</i> out before she interrupted him.</p><p>&#x201c;You have&#x2014;or will have&#x2014;something I want, just as I have something you want. So, this is the bargain: you may continue to help yourself to this garden. I would prefer that you come at night, so that I don&#x2019;t have other thieves coming to steal from me, and you might as well keep coming over the wall as well, since you are so good at it. Then, when your wife gives birth to this new child, you will give her to me.&#x201d; He opened his mouth to object. She stared at him with her lips compressed into a thin line. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to barter with me. It is this, or I set the dogs on you and have the police take what is left of you to prison. What will it be? Will you feed your eight children and your wife for the trivial price of a baby that is likely to die anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>Well, what <i>could</i> he say? If he refused, what would Maria and the children do but starve? What good would it do him <i>or</i> them if he suddenly decided that selling the baby was wrong? &#x201c;Very well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; he said, slowly.</p><p>She smiled, as if she had already known he would say as much. &#x201c;Take what you have. Come back tomorrow night. I&#x2019;ll even leave sacks for you.&#x201d;</p><p>And with that, she turned on her heel and stalked back into the house, her dogs preceding her. They all went in via the kitchen door&#x2014;which showed not so much as a hint of light&#x2014;and she closed the door behind her, leaving him chilled and drenched with sweat on the cold earth of the garden.<br><br>* * * * *</p><p>It was not an easy birth.</p><p>When it was over, Maria lay too exhausted to even move beneath a heap of every scrap of fabric that could be spared to keep her warm, and the new baby girl had been tightly wrapped and was being held by Jakob near to the fire. Friedrich was just glad Maria had had three weeks of good food before the birth; he really didn&#x2019;t think she would have survived this one without the extra nourishment. She&#x2019;d gone into labor the previous afternoon, and it had gone on until well after sunrise.</p><p>He was just as tired, since he had served as midwife. He was slowly eating vegetable soup and drinking herb tea, his first meal since she had gone into labor. And he really wasn&#x2019;t thinking of anything else when the knock came at the door. Before he could say anything, his second oldest, Johann, jumped up to answer it.</p><p>And fell back again, in astonishment and fear, as the terrible woman in black and one of her dogs pushed their way in.</p><p>She closed the door behind her and surveyed them all with an icy glare.</p><p>The children all froze in terror; the tall woman was no less forbidding and formidable in broad daylight than she had been by night. The dog didn&#x2019;t growl, but he didn&#x2019;t have to; he looked like a black wolf, which was more than enough to make the children try to inch back until they were squeezed into the corner farthest from her.</p><p>All but Jakob, who remained where he was, by the fire, the baby clutched in his nerveless hands.</p><p>Before Friedrich could utter a word, the woman looked around the room and spotted Jakob and the baby. In four strides she had crossed the room, then bent and snatched the baby out of Jakob&#x2019;s arms.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come for your part of the bargain, Friedrich Schnittel,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And now I&#x2019;ll be gone.&#x201d;</p><p>And with that, she turned, stalked out the door, and left.</p><p>Maria fell into hysterics, of course&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t told her about the bargain. When he explained, she only became more hysterical, weeping and pushing him away until he just gave up trying to reason with her, and, for lack of anything else to do, made sure the children were all fed. As they all ate, she cried herself into a sleep that was less sleep than collapse, and he stared at her white, tear-streaked face and wondered where the girl he had fallen in love with had gone.</p><p>When Maria awoke, she refused to speak to him. After a while, he got tired of the silence and decided to make another visit to the garden. The terrible woman had not put an end-date on <i>her</i> part of the bargain, and he was determined to get as much out of it as he could.</p><p>He was beginning to resent Maria&#x2019;s attitude. The woman had been right, after all. If not for the food, Maria, the baby, or both probably would have died. And what about the eight <i>other</i> children? Didn&#x2019;t <i>they</i> warrant some consideration too? Didn&#x2019;t they deserve to have full bellies for once? Wasn&#x2019;t one baby likely to die anyway worth bartering away to save the lives of his living children?</p><p>At this point, he was a little drunk on exhaustion himself, and a little reckless. And he went in&#x2014;if not <i>broad </i>daylight, certainly just before sundown. By the time he got over the wall, he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not exactly seething, but feeling far more the victim than the victimizer. And it occurred to him that if he could just get a glimpse inside that house, perhaps he could see that the baby was being treated in a manner far better than he and Maria could ever afford, and perhaps that might make the foolish woman see reason.</p><p>But as he approached the house&#x2014;he noticed that the kitchen door was slightly ajar.</p><p><i>That&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. odd.</i></p><p>He made his way carefully to the door, and when nothing came out of it&#x2014;especially not an enormous, possibly vicious dog&#x2014;he pushed it all the way open.</p><p>Nothing. And there was no sound in the house, at all.</p><p>He ventured inside.</p><p>The kitchen was utterly empty. And so was the next room. And the next.</p><p>The caution ebbed out of him, and he began to prowl the entire house while the light lasted: all the rooms, downstairs and the two stories above. No furnishings, only a piece or two, like the great bed in one of the bedchambers, which would have been impossible to move. No sign that anyone had lived here, except for the absence of dust.</p><p>As he stood there in the empty house&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a plan formed in his mind.</p><p>There was a gate to the garden; he had always come and gone over the wall, but now, he ran to it and forced the rusty lock and latch open. Then he ran back to his little room.</p><p>By this time, he was somewhat incoherent, probably wild-eyed, and talking like a madman. But that was no bad thing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the children looked at him with bewilderment and fear and did not ask him questions. With words and a few blows for those too stubborn to obey immediately, he gathered up the children and all of their meager possessions, forced Maria to her feet, and drove them out the door, down the street, and in through the gate.</p><p>At this point even Maria looked afraid of him and kept any objections to herself.</p><p>He locked the gate behind them all and herded them in through the kitchen door. &#x201c;This is our home, now,&#x201d; he said sternly. &#x201c;At least it is until someone comes to tell us differently.&#x201d;</p><p>The children made up the bed of rags and straw for Maria again, and she crept into it, shivering.</p><p>Once the family was installed in the kitchen&#x2014;which alone was three or four times the size of the room they <i>had</i> been living in&#x2014;he left them there, instructing Jakob to make up a fire with the plentiful firewood that was already there. Then he ran back and forth until he had brought all of the food that they had cached, and their old room was scoured bare of anything remotely useful, down to the smallest of rags.</p><p>Then he returned to the deserted house, locked the gate behind him, and joined the rest of his family in their new home.</p><p>Yes. Their home. For it had come to him, as he had seen this empty, echoing house, why should it go to waste? It had been untenanted for as long as he could remember. If that woman came back she could easily evict him and his family, but in the meantime, why should they not save the rent money and live here, where the garden and its bounty were easily accessible? Why not?</p><p>Maria was terrified at this new version of her husband, who had gone from stealing turnips to &#x201c;stealing&#x201d; an entire house&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and truth to tell, he was not displeased with this. At least it stopped her from reproaching him.<br><br>* * * * *</p><p>The strange woman never returned to her house.</p><p>And Maria never forgave him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>GISELLE leaned out of the window of her room at the top of the tower and drank in all the spring fragrances being carried up to her on the breeze. Her room had the best view of any in the former abbey, and she often wondered who had been the tenant back when the complex had been inhabited by the Sisters of Saint Benedict. The abbess herself? Or perhaps it had been a room devoted to communal prayer?</p><p><i>Probably the abbess,</i> she decided. It would have been a good place from which to keep an eye on the entire abbey. Mother said she had no idea why the abbey had been abandoned for so long, to the point where only the tower had been inhabitable when she had first taken it over, and only because the entire tower was built of stout stone. That had been long before Giselle had been born. By the time Mother brought her here as an infant, the tower had been completely renovated, all the other buildings had been reroofed with proper, strong tile, and the building attached to the tower itself, which had probably housed the nuns in their little cells, had been converted into spacious living quarters for Mother. Only the chapel remained in ruins. Mother never explained why she had not rebuilt the chapel, but then, why should she have? It wasn&#x2019;t as if she and Giselle needed a church.</p><p>There were four windows in Giselle&#x2019;s tower room, facing precisely in the four directions of the compass. Giselle preferred the view from the east window, which looked out over the valley meadow to the forest beyond, and to the mountains beyond that. Probably, back when the abbess had lived here, there had been nothing to keep out the winter winds but simple wooden shutters, and only a charcoal brazier to huddle over to keep out the cold. Mother had changed all that. There were proper glass windows <i>and</i> shutters in all the windows now, and a good fireplace on each floor of the tower.</p><p>Giselle wondered if dwarves had done the work. She&#x2019;d never seen any here, but then, the work had been completed before she ever got here. Since it had all been stonework, it would have been logical for Mother to have made a bargain with dwarves to accomplish it. Mother was an Earth Master, after all, and dwarves were Earth Elementals.</p><p><i>I certainly can&#x2019;t imagine her allowing ordinary stonemasons here.</i></p><p>The nearest village&#x2014;and it was a very small one&#x2014;was over two days&#x2019; ride away, in the next valley over from the abbey. You couldn&#x2019;t even see it from the top room of the tower. Giselle had never been there herself, only Mother, driving the cart out to get the things they could not produce for themselves and coming back again days later. Still, it wasn&#x2019;t as if she could be lonely. Not when she was surrounded by all the Elementals of her own Element, Air.</p></p><h2>Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came to Be</h2><p>Evolution is the process that created the terrible teeth of Tyrannosaurus rex and the complex human brain, clever enough to understand the workings of nature. Young readers will learn how a British naturalist named Charles Darwin studied nature and developed his now-famous concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest. And how modern-day science has added to our understanding of the theory of evolution. <br><br>Can something as complex and wondrous as the natural world be explained by a simple theory? The answer is yes, and now Evolution explains how in a way that makes it easy to understand.</p><p>Daniel Loxton is Editor of Junion Skeptic, the children's section of Skeptic magazine, a quarterly science education and science advocacy magazine published by the nonprofit Skeptics Society.

Daniel is the author and illustrator of Evolution. He lives in Victoria, B.C.</p>Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Loxton uses a combination of Q &amp; A and exposition in his conversational text to explore the process of evolution. He even makes reference to religion, stating that while science, exemplary in explaining the functionalism of the natural world, "can't tell us what those discoveries mean in a spiritual sense." Topics addressed include whether it is possible to see new species evolve, the evolution of flight, and the dearth of many "transitional" fossils. Other facing-page units discuss evolutionary compromises, Darwinian theory, and the fact that "survival of the fittest" may often be the "survival of the adequate." Colorful illustrations and diagrams appear on every page, and the book uses a variety of faces/heads with each "question," giving the impression they are asked by individuals. More difficult than Steve Jenkins's <i>Life on Earth: The Story of Evolution</i> (Houghton, 2002), almost on par with Robert Winston's <i>Evolution Revolution</i> (2009), and simpler than Linda Gamlin's <i>Evolution</i> (2009, both DK), this title will appeal to researchers.&#x2014;<i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

He starts with a compelling case of good reasons for anyone to study theology, and the wonderful rewards that accompany such a pursuit.</p><p>After explaining how God is Spirit, Sheed examines God's infinity and man's creation from nothing. He then covers in depth such key doctrines as the Trinity, the Fall, the Incarnation and Redemption, the Mystical Body, Grace and the Sacraments, and the Last Things. For those to whom these doctrines seem formidable, Sheed brings a fresh approach with lucid and carefully reasoned prose. His beautiful insights and clear explanations will help stir our minds to the inspiring truth of the spiritual realities at the center of human existence.</p></p><p><p><b>Frank Sheed</b> was one of the best -known Catholic writers and apologists of the 20th century. He founded the Catholic publishing house of Sheed &amp; Ward.

At its core the Anglo-Dutch relationship intertwined close alliance and fierce antagonism to intense creative effect. But a precondition for the Industrial Revolution was also the establishment in British North America of a unique type of colony&#x2014;for the settlement of people and culture, rather than the extraction of commodities.<br> &nbsp;<br> England&#x2019;s republican revolution of 1649&#x2013;53 was a spectacular attempt to change social, political, and moral life in the direction pioneered by the Dutch. In this powerfully written account, Jonathan Scott argues that it was also a turning point in world history. In its wake, competition with the Dutch transformed the military-fiscal and naval resources of the British state. Within the resulting naval-protected Anglo-American trading monopoly, the demographic and commercial vibrancy of British North America played a crucial role in triggering the Industrial Revolution.</p><p><b>Jonathan Scott </b>is professor of history at the University of Auckland.

With inimitable grace and aching emotional precision, Godwin probes our own complexities in characters whose lives oscillate between success and struggle, stoic resolve and quixotic temptation, bitter disappointment and small, sacred joys. Now with Evensong, she again translates our everyday existence into soul-touching truths as she brings to brilliantly realized life the people of a small Smoky Mountain town--and a woman whose world is indelibly altered by them.</p><p>In the tight-knit Smoky Mountain town of High Balsam, several weeks before the new millennium, Margaret Bonner finds herself pondering the notion of marriage. "I was mystified anew by this whole thing we humans do when we take it into our heads to love one particular person," she muses. At 33, she is the first woman pastor of All Saints Episcopal Church, and her husband, Adrian, is the headmaster of a progressive high school. The Bonners are in a marital slump--Adrian's self-loathing exasperates his younger, more passionate wife and she can't resist imagining what life would be like without him. Yet as the end of the century approaches, they are forced to turn their attention outward and respond to the escalating needs of their North Carolina community. The appearance of three colorful misfits brings matters to a head. Grace Munger, an aggressive fundamentalist Christian, is on a crusade to organize a "Millennium Birthday March for Jesus"; Brother Tony, a chatty 80-year-old itinerant who's taken up the life of a Benedictine monk, has a particular interest in Adrian; and Chase, a 16-year-old delinquent, harbors a thirst for liquor, with calamitous consequences. In her sequel to <i>Father Melancholy's Daughter</i>, Gail Godwin expertly traces the contours of faith, compassion, and loyalty in an isolated community on the brink of change. <i>--Rebecca Robinson</i><br>"Rich.

Chairman Mao has declared a new openness in society: "Let a hundred flowers bloom; let a hundred schools of thought contend." Many intellectuals fear it is only a trick, and Kai Ying's husband, Sheng, a teacher, has promised not to jeopardize their safety or that of their young son, Tao. But one July morning, just before his sixth birthday, Tao watches helplessly as Sheng is dragged away for writing a letter criticizing the Communist Party and sent to a labor camp for "reeducation." </p><p>A year later, still missing his father desperately, Tao climbs to the top of the hundred-year-old kapok tree in front of their home, wanting to see the mountain peaks in the distance. But Tao slips and tumbles thirty feet to the courtyard below, badly breaking his leg. </p><p>As Kai Ying struggles to hold her small family together in the face of this shattering reminder of her husband's absence, other members of the household must face their own guilty secrets and strive to find peace in a world where the old sense of order is falling. Once again, Tsukiyama brings us a powerfully moving story of ordinary people facing extraordinary circumstances with grace and courage.</p></p><p><p>Gail Tsukiyama is the bestselling author of six previous novels, including <i>The Street of a Thousand Blossoms, Women of the Silk </i>and <i>The Samurai's Garden, </i>as well as the recipient of the Academy of American Poets Award and the PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award. She lives in El Cerrito, California.</p>Tao<br>&nbsp;<br>The courtyard was still quiet so early in the morning, the neighborhood just waking as Neighbor Lau&#x2019;s rooster began to crow. The air was already warm, a taste of the heat and humidity that would be unbearable by midday. Seven-year-old Tao knew he had little time to climb the kapok tree before he&#x2019;d be discovered. He glanced down at the gnarled roots of the tree and felt strangely comforted, a reminder of the crooked ginger roots his <i>ma ma</i> sliced and boiled into strong teas for her headaches, or when his <i>ba ba</i> complained of indigestion.<br>Tao wasn&#x2019;t afraid as he shimmied up the kapok tree&#x2019;s slender trunk toward the broad branches, avoiding thorns on the spiny offshoots of the same tree his father had climbed as a boy, his heart thumping in excitement at the idea of seeing White Cloud Mountain from up so high. From the time he was two, his father would lift him up to look out his bedroom window, or from the second-floor balcony, as they searched for the mountain in the far distance. His <i>ba ba</i> always told him that if he looked hard enough, he could see all of Guangzhou and as far away as White Cloud Mountain on a clear day. With its thirty peaks, the mountain was a magical place for him, and his eyes watered with an effort to glimpse just a shadow of an elusive peak.<br>Tao could still feel the rough stubble of his father&#x2019;s cheek against his, like the scratchy military blankets they used at school during naptime when he was younger. But last July, just before his sixth birthday, everything changed. Angry voices filled the courtyard early one morning, his father&#x2019;s voice rising above them all, followed by the sound of scuffling. He looked out the window to see his <i>ba ba</i>&#x2019;s hands bound behind his back as he was dragged away by two unsmiling policemen in drab green uniforms. He saw his grandfather trying to push closer to his father, only to be roughly shoved back by one of the policemen. &#x201c;Where are you taking him?&#x201d; his mother&#x2019;s lone voice cried out from the gate. But all he heard was a roar of the Jeep, and then they were gone.<br>After his father was taken away, when his mother and grandfather thought he was still asleep, Tao heard their low whispers, but when he made his way downstairs, the whispering had stopped. He saw his mother crying and his grandfather sitting in the shadows as still as stone. He wanted them to answer all his questions. &#x201c;Where did <i>ba ba</i> go? Why did those men take him away? When will he come home again?&#x201d;<br>Before he could say a word, his mother pulled him toward her and hugged him. &#x201c;<i>Ba ba</i> had to go away for a little while,&#x201d; she told him. He smelled the mix of sweat and the scent of boiled herbs in her hair and on her clothes and he blurted out, &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t <i>ba ba</i> tell me he had to go away?&#x201d; But she held tightly on to him and a strange sound came from her throat. Only then did he understand his father was really gone and his questions would remain unanswered. He squeezed his eyes shut so he couldn&#x2019;t see her crying.<br>From that day on, his father was no longer there to tell him about White Cloud Mountain. At first Tao was scared and confused, wanting only to feel his <i>ba ba</i>&#x2019;s warmth beside him and to hear his laughter coming from the courtyard. Tao searched for his father in all the places they had gone together: down by the tree-lined canal, through the alleyways that separated the redbrick apartment buildings, in and out of the crowded, narrow streets lined with restaurants, and in the small shop where his father always bought him sweets filled with red bean and rolled in sesame seeds on their way to Dongshan Park. It was as if they were playing a game of hide-and-seek; he thought his <i>ba ba</i> would have to come out of hiding sooner or later. But he never did.<br>Mr. Lam, the shopkeeper, brought Tao safely back home, but not before he reached up to the shelves and took down a glass jar and slipped him a piece of candy, the same sugar candy that his mother&#x2019;s patients often sucked on after drinking an especially bitter tea.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, your <i>ba ba</i> will be back soon,&#x201d; he said reassuringly.<br>Tao nodded, but all he tasted as he sucked on the hard candy was grief.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>For a whole year, his <i>ba ba</i> returned to him only in dreams. Tao felt his presence in the shadows, the calm of his voice, the safe, solid grasp as he lifted him up and into the air, and the sweet scent of his cologne. The idea of climbing the tree had come to him in a dream just that morning: he was perched at the top of the kapok tree and could finally see all the way to White Cloud Mountain and there on one of the peaks stood his father waiting for him.<br>Tao suddenly heard the slow whine of a door opening and peered anxiously at the balcony. He held his breath and waited, but no one emerged as the air seeped slowly back out from between his lips. Sometimes his mother stepped out in the mornings to check the weather, or to see if she had any patients waiting. On this particular morning, he was relieved to see that the neighborhood was slow to wake.<br>His mother, Kai Ying, was something of a well-known herbalist and healer in their Dongshan neighborhood, where the quiet streets were lined with once-stately red and gray brick villas that surrounded their courtyard. She was known for her restorative teas and soups that cured many of the neighbors&#x2019; ailments. People came and went through the courtyard all day long, wanting her advice to treat some pressing malady. On any given morning there would likely be a patient or two already waiting anxiously at the gate to see her. But only after his mother fed him and his grandfather breakfast did she walk out to unlock the gate and let the first patient in. And it wasn&#x2019;t until she ministered to the last person waiting that she locked the gate again at night.<br>According to Tao&#x2019;s grandfather, it was his great-grandfather, a wealthy businessman, who built one of the first villas in the Dongshan area, once a remote and isolated part of Guangzhou where mostly military families lived. By the 1920s, there were hundreds of villas in the area. Most were two or three stories, designed in the European style with high ceilings and columned balconies. Tao&#x2019;s family still lived in the same brick villa that was built by his great-grandfather, whose portrait hung on their living room wall. And though his great-grandfather had died long before Tao was born, he felt as if he knew the white-haired, stern-looking man wearing a dark blue silk <i>changshan,</i> standing tall in his long mandarin gown as he gazed down at him. He always thought of his great-grandfather as an intrinsic part of the house, just like the faded redbrick walls, the sweeping stairway and square-paned windows, the second-story balcony, and the wide-open courtyard that was specifically built around the kapok tree. Dongshan was the only district in Guangzhou that had houses with large, open courtyards.<br>After the Communists came into power in 1949, the two-story redbrick villa had been divided among three families. Tao&#x2019;s now lived on the top floor that opened up to the second-floor balcony. Auntie Song lived in a smaller apartment facing the backyard, and Mr. and Mrs. Chang, an older couple who were currently away visiting their daughter in Nanjing, lived in the rooms downstairs. They all shared the kitchen, though the Changs kept to themselves and usually took their meals in their room. Auntie Song occasionally ate with them, but preferred to cook the vegetables she grew in her backyard garden on a small hot plate in her apartment. Tao&#x2019;s grandfather often told him that when he was a boy, the entire house belonged exclusively to his family. Tao couldn&#x2019;t imagine what it must be like to have so many rooms to run through.<br>Lately, he noticed his grandfather was repeating the same old boyhood stories, many of which took place in the courtyard, where the tall, spiny-armed kapok tree stood guard. He knew his grandfather was an only son, though he had five much older half sisters. Tao imagined the kapok tree had provided his grandfather with company, just as it did for him. &#x201c;The tree has been here for a very long time,&#x201d; his <i>ye ye</i> repeated, just yesterday. &#x201c;Think of all it has seen over the years, all that it has heard,&#x201d; he added. His grandfather gazed up at the tree as if he could see the past in each of its limbs.<br>&#x201c;A tree can&#x2019;t see or hear,&#x201d; Tao said.<br>His grandfather looked down at him and smiled. &#x201c;How do you know? It&#x2019;s a living thing. Just because it doesn&#x2019;t have eyes and ears the way we do, how can we know it doesn&#x2019;t feel things in other ways?&#x201d;<br>Tao thought about it for a moment. &#x201c;Just like we can&#x2019;t see how water and sunlight make it grow?&#x201d; he asked. His grandfather, Wei, and his father, Sheng, were both teachers. Ever since Tao was a very little boy, he felt their joy every time he asked questions and was eager to learn something new.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; his grandfather said, and clapped his hands once. &#x201c;Exactly like that! So many things happen around us without our seeing or knowing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How old is the tree?&#x201d;<br>His <i>ye ye</i> stroked the gray hairs on his chin. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I would say it was planted during the Ch&#x2019;ing Dynasty, the last great Chinese dynasty, so well over a hundred years ago.&#x201d;<br>Tao nodded and counted in his head. His grandfather was seventy-one and he was going to be seven. The tree was older than both of their ages combined.<br>His <i>ye ye</i> and his parents constantly reminded him of how thankful he should be to be surrounded by nature, and how lucky they were to share it with their neighbors. Just four months earlier in the heart of March, his grandfather had marveled at the kapok&#x2019;s red blossoms that were in full bloom, bold and unafraid.

Beginning with the late 1960s as a time when compulsory sexuality intensified and became increasingly tied to feminist, lesbian, and queer notions of empowerment, politics, and subjectivity, Przybylo looks to feminist political celibacy/asexuality, lesbian bed death, the asexual queer child, and the aging spinster as four figures that are asexually resonant and which benefit from an asexual reading&#x2014;that is, from being read in an asexually affirming rather than asexually skeptical manner.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through a wide-ranging analysis of pivotal queer, feminist, and anti-racist movements; television and film; art and photography; and fiction, nonfiction, and theoretical texts, each chapter explores asexual erotics and demonstrates how&nbsp;asexuality has been vital to the formulation of intimate ways of knowing and being.&nbsp;<i>Asexual Erotics</i>&nbsp;assembles a compendium of asexual possibilities that speaks against the centralization of sex and sexuality,&nbsp;asking that we consider the ways in which compulsory sexuality is detrimental not only to asexual and nonsexual people but to all.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Ela Przybylo is Assistant Professor in the Department of English at Illinois State University.&#x201c;This book contributes an expanded repertoire of objects of analysis for feminist and queer studies in addition to refining and developing asexual theoretical and methodological frameworks that demand a reshaping of scholarship on sexuality and queerness.&#x201d; &#x2014;KJ Cerankowski<br><br><i>&#x201c;Asexual Erotics</i> is a much-needed study on queer theory&#x2019;s obsession with &#x2018;sex&#x2019; as an underpinning force. What&#x2019;s more, it shows that paying attention to &#x2018;erotics&#x2019; opens up new intersectional possibilities for thinking with and through difference in ways that a focus on sex and sexuality can prohibit. It makes a timely intervention in feminist studies and queer studies and provides important material for disability scholars, trans studies scholars, and visual and media studies scholars.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jennifer Tyburczy</p><h2>The Luzhin Defense</h2><p>Vladimir Nabokov&#39;s early novel is the dazzling story of the coarse, strange yet oddly endearing chess-playing genius Luzhin. Discovering his prodigious gift in boyhood and rising to the rank of International Grandmaster, Luzhin develops a lyrical passion for chess that renders the real world a phantom. As he confronts the fiery, swift-swooping Italian Grandmaster Turati, he brings into play his carefully devised defence. Making masterly play of metaphor and imagery, &#34;The Luzhin Defense&#34; is the book that, of his early works, Nabokov felt &#39;contains and diffuses the greatest warmth&#39;.</p><p>Vladimir Nabokov was born in 1899 in St Petersburg. He wrote his first literary works in Russian, but rose to international prominence as a masterly prose stylist for the novels he composed in English, most famously, Lolita. Between 1923 and 1940 he published novels, short stories, plays, poems and translations in the Russian language and established himself as one of the most outstanding Russian emigre writers. He died in 1977.He did us all an honour by electing to use, and transform, our language. * Anthony Burgess * Nabokov can move you to laughter in the way that masters can - to laughter that is near to tears. * The Guardian *</p><h2>I Remain in Darkness</h2><p>An extraordinary evocation of a grown daughter&#39;s attachment to her mother, and of both women&#39;s strength and resiliency. I REMAIN IN DARKNESS recounts Ernaux&#39;s attempts first to help her mother recover from Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and then, when that proves futile, to bear witness to the older woman&#39;s gradual decline and her own experience as a daughter losing a beloved parent. I REMAIN IN DARKNESS is a new high water mark for Ernaux, surging with raw emotional power and her sublime ability to use language to apprehend her own life&#39;s particular music.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Temple (The Last Disciple)</h2><p>Set in the turbulent years just before one of the most horrendous events in Jewish history, <i>The Last Temple</i> concludes the trilogy of <i>The Last Disciple</i> and <i>The Last Sacrifice</i>. Vitas is reunited with his wife and retires to Alexandria, determined to live a quiet, domestic life. But he can&#x2019;t avoid the debts that he owes to the men who saved him, and he becomes a key figure in the plot to rid the empire of Nero. It sweeps him into the &#x201c;year of four emperors,&#x201d; when the Roman Empire is nearly destroyed, and takes him back to Jerusalem as Titus lays siege to the great city. Only then, as the prophecy of Jesus begins to unfold, does Vitas discover the true mission set before him and the astounding conspiracy behind it.</p><p><b>The beast is dead, yet lives on.</b><br>War tears apart the holy land.<br>And Roman legions are on the verge of fulfilling an impossible prophecy of the christos: the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br>Even after escaping death in the arena and crucifixion in Judea, Vitas is denied the comfort of settling down with his wife and child. Powerful men are conspiring against the emperor, and Vitas has his own motives to seek revenge against Nero.<br><br>Amid the empire&#x2019;s turmoil, Judea continues to defy Rome. Jerusalem is in danger not just from Rome&#x2019;s military might but from its own warring factions. Would God truly abandon the Holy City and the Temple?In the final installment of the authors&#x2019; trilogy (<i>The Last Sacrifice, The Last Disciple</i>), Jerusalem continues to experience the prophesies that early Christians believe will lead to the end of days. Vitas, the novel&#x2019;s warrior-hero, has returned home to Alexandria, where he and his wife are determined to lead a quiet life. But because of debts owed to the men who saved him, Vitas becomes involved in a plot to rid the Roman empire of Nero, a conspiracy that eventually leads him back to Jerusalem now besieged by Titus. <b>Verdict:</b> Though the dialog tends to be didactic, the plot moves along quickly. Many readers will be looking for apocalyptic fiction this year, and those who enjoy the works of Tim LaHaye may find similarities here.

The little city of Hudson, New York (pop.8,000), was for many years the unlikely setting for a world of prostitution, gambling, murder, and government corruption with more than a touch of the Keystone Kops thrown in. In the century or so before 1950, dozens of madams, bootleggers, and gamblers held sway there, making Hudson famous as a mini sin city. There were at least two major illegal horse rooms, a big-stakes floating dice game, and as many as fifteen houses of ill repute. Meanwhile, the church suppers took place and the parades marched up and down as Hudson&#39;s respectable citizenry convinced themselves that there was nothing out of the ordinary in this town described as ten streets wide and ten streets deep ... a Norman Rockwell painting in motion.</p><p>This is the astonishing illicit history of Hudson, New York, which for many years was the unlikely setting for a world of prostitution, gambling, murder, and government corruption&#x2014;with more than a touch of the Keystone Kops thrown in.In the century or so before 1950, Hudson was famous as a shopping center of vice.

German mobile assault gun and tank destroyer</h2><p>The German Sturmgesch�tz series of assault guns was a successful and cost-effective range of armoured fighting vehicles; of which some 10,000 were built during the Second World War. Based on the chassis of the Panzer III tank; the turret was replaced by an armoured fixed superstructure fitted with a more powerful 7.5cm StuK 40 L/48 gun. Originally intended as a mobile assault weapon for infantry support; the StuG was constantly modified and saw extensive use on all battlefronts as an assault gun and tank destroyer. Its fixed superstructure with limited-traverse mounting for the main armament was simpler and cheaper to build than the turret of the battle tank; plus its low height meant it was easy to camouflage and conceal. Towards the end of the war; more StuGs were built than tanks.<br><br> StuGs also saw combat when used by several Axis allies; notably Romania and Finland. They were also exported to Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. The Soviet Union gave some of their captured German vehicles to Syria in the 1950s, which continued to use them up until the War over Water against Israel in the mid-1960s. By the time of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War in 1967; all of them had been either destroyed, stripped for spare parts, or placed on the Golan Heights as static pillboxes.</p><p><p><b>Mark Healy</b> is the author of the Haynes <i>T-34 Tank Manual</i> as well as&nbsp;<i>Panther Tank Manual.</i>&nbsp;<i>Midway 1942, The Tiger Tank Story</i> and <i>Zitadelle: The German Offensive against the Kursk Salient 14&#x2013;17 July 1943</i>.

Frederick George is a historian and writer living in Paris.one<br><br>MARCH 1990<br><br>CLYDE BANKS was standing in line, in the early stages of hypothermia, when he first saw his future wife, Desiree Dhont, wrestle. At the time, both of them were juniors at Wapsipinicon High School. Its Wade Olin gym, home of the Little Twisters, was named after the greatest wrestler in the history of the world--an alumnus. It was connected to the high school proper by a glass-walled breezeway, which enabled students to pass back and forth between academics and PE, even in the middle of winter, without getting lost in whiteouts.<br><br>On the night in question the Little Twisters were about to play a basketball game against their archrivals from just across the river: the Nishnabotna Injuns. The ticket line filled the breezeway and extended into the parking lot. The early arrivals' breath condensed on the insides of the glass walls, which became steamy in the middle and frosty around the edges. The steel framework of the breezeway was growing leaves of frost.<br><br>Clyde Banks was on the outside and Desiree Dhont was on the inside, which was typical of their lives at that point. He did not mind the cold, because this arrangement enabled him to stand and stare through the frosty windows at Desiree without her being aware of it.<br><br>Clyde was a quiet sort who spent a lot of time thinking about things. During this period he primarily thought about Desiree. He had not spent much time outside the upper Midwest and so had not graduated to more cosmic and general issues--for example, whether it was advisable to live in a part of the country so inimical to life that buildings only a few dozen feet apart had to be connected by expensive glass tunnels.<br><br>Clyde was not the only young man staring at Desiree, but he did have a more highly developed contemplative faculty than most of the others, and so he had come up with a rationalization for why Desiree and he were a natural match for each other: neither one of them was technically from Wapsipinicon. Clyde lived on the other side of the river, just outside Nishnabotna, and should have been going to the county high school, but his grandfather and guardian, Ebenezer, who had a thing about education, wouldn't hear of this and dug up a wad of money from one of his hundreds of tiny, secret, widely dispersed bank accounts, or perhaps just dug up some gold coins from one of his many secret, widely dispersed coffee cans, and actually paid tuition to send Clyde to school in Wapsipinicon.<br><br>Desiree's family lived several miles south of town, on a farm. The farm lay adjacent to a spur on the Denver-Platte-Des Moines Railway. This particular spur ran up into the middle of the Eastern Iowa University campus, taking coal to the university power plant. When Dan Dhont, Jr., the oldest Dhont boy, had reached junior high school, the Wapsipinicon City Council had voted to annex the first few miles of the railway spur. The Wapsipinicon town line now sported a long, needle-thin, Aleutian-like isthmus running straight out to the Dhont farm. Accordingly, Dan Dhont and all the other Dhonts matriculated and, more to the point, wrestled in Wapsipinicon.<br><br>So there was sort of a connection between Clyde and Desiree from the very beginning, or so Clyde had, by dint of lengthy contemplation, led himself to believe. He had not yet figured out a way to parlay this uncanny link into an actual conversation with the girl, but he was working on it. He had run through a number of options in his head, but all of them required ten or fifteen minutes of preliminary explanation, and he did not think this was the best way to get started.<br><br>Equally absorbed in the charms of Desiree Dhont was a Nishnabotna boy standing just behind her in line. Naturally, he was traveling with a whole group of other Nishnabotna boys. Just as naturally they egged him on, shouldering him forward playfully until he was almost rubbing up against her. After all, what was a Wapsipinicon/Nishnabotna athletic event without a few incidents of assault, battery, rape, and even attempted murder, perpetrated by Injuns against Little Twisters?<br><br>Finally the boy from Nishnabotna made the stupid but (to Clyde) wholly understandable mistake of reaching out and grabbing Desiree Dhont's left buttock.<br><br>Not in his worst nightmares did this boy imagine that Desiree might be in any way related to the Dhonts. There was no family resemblance. After bearing five consecutive male children, Mrs. Dhont had concluded, contrary to medical opinion, that she was biologically incapable of having little girls, so she and Dan, Sr., had gone out and adopted Desiree from somewhere. Then she had vindicated her decision, and flummoxed the doctors, by having another three boys.<br><br>Unlike the biological Dhonts, Desiree tanned. She tanned marvelously and perfectly. Her dark eyes were set at an outlandish and seductive angle, and her thick, glossy hair was perfectly black. So the boy from Nishnabotna could not have known he was in danger; this alluring creature was cut off from her natural ethnic group, whatever that might be, and he could have his way with her.<br><br>Everyone has a role in the cosmic story, no matter how small, dangerous, or humiliating. The roles picked out for boys from Nishnabotna tended to fit all three descriptions. This one's was to answer a question that had confounded the wisest gossips and blowhards of Wapsipinicon for at least a decade, to wit: Could Desiree Dhont wrestle?<br><br>Everyone knew that the living room of the Dhont house had a wrestling mat instead of a carpet. Everyone knew that there was another mat on the basement floor. The Des Moines Register had printed an aerial photo of the farmstead showing their outdoor mat in the side yard, next to a home-built weight-training set under the shade of the windbreak. Everyone knew that the Dhont boys learned how to wrestle before they learned how to walk, and that Darius Dhont, upon bursting from his mother's womb after forty-eight hours of furious labor, had gripped a nurse's lower lip in an illegal hold, his long newborn's fingernails darting four tiny crescent-shaped cuts into her mucous membranes before Dan, Sr., had spanked him loose, one, two, three, like a ref slapping a mat.<br><br>Smart money said no. The whole idea behind having Desiree was that Mrs. Dhont would have a more feminine presence around the house. Why go to all that trouble to import X chromosomes from Timbuktu and then have her rolling around the living room in bib overalls, body-slamming her muscular brothers? So Desiree had been raised to be markedly feminine in more than just her name. Clyde had attended the same junior high school as Desiree, and he could still remember sitting behind her in algebra, tracing the construction of her French braids--straight dark hair pulled in on itself, stretched to explosive tension like the strings of a piano--and getting woozy over the lace that draped around her tanned neck like a ring of Ivory soapsuds.<br><br>The mystery had deepened when they had matriculated at Wapsipinicon High School. In order to justify the expense of the indoor swimming facility, all students had to take swimming classes. The girls changed into stunning black spandex one-pieces, and all the boys were stripped down to black spandex trunks that didn't conceal things any more effectively than their own supply of pubic hair. They needed no encouragement to get into the water.<br><br>The girls' suits were cut deep in the back, and everyone knew that a fella could grasp the straps from behind and pull them apart and down and strip a girl naked to the waist like shucking an ear of corn. So all the girls pulled the laces out of their gym shoes and used them to tie the straps together between their shoulder blades. Clyde spent at least a night a week fantasizing about this unbearably erotic rite: all the girls in the locker room binding each other's straps together with dingy gray shoelaces, pulling those granny knots tight, locking their breasts away so that only the greenish water of the pool could touch them. It made the suits visually narrower, as seen from behind, which made the girls' shoulders look broader than they were.<br><br>Desiree Dhont was thus given away by her deltoids. By the end of her first swimming class everyone knew that Desiree had indeed been full-nelsoning her siblings since she had been in the cradle. They were not at all masculine, not unbecoming at all, and underneath them her armpits were as sheer and smooth as the backs of her knees. But unmistakably they were powerful and developed, death-dealing Dhont deltoids, fairer and sexier than any breast or buttock.<br><br>And on the night in question they were concealed beneath Desiree's fluffy down-filled ski jacket. The boy from Nishnabotna knew nothing of the deltoids. He only knew that Desiree was a relatively tall girl; but he was even taller, and he was a boy, and he was with his friends, tough Nishnabotna boys who worked throwing hay bales and pig corpses. He was safe. He reached out and grabbed her ass.<br>He blinked as Desiree's long black braid snapped across his face, whipped around by tremendous centrifugal force.<br><br>She was in violent motion; his hand was empty before the pleasing sensation had even traveled up his arm to his brain.<br><br>A moment later she was behind him and his arm had been wrenched up behind his back, bent like a hairpin. Desiree shoved him face first across the breezeway and gave his arm a final twist. He opened his mouth to holler.<br><br>The sound was muffled by a chunk of steel window frame that went directly against his tongue. The frame was not insulated. It was January. Desiree let him go but the window frame didn't. His tongue, and about fifty percent of his lips' surface area, remained flash-frozen in place, as if the window frame had been coated with Krazy Glue.<br><br>Her girlfriend held her place in line. Desiree returned, hitching her jeans back around.<br><br>"My name's Desiree," she said. Desiree had been in this country since the age of five weeks, but Clyde still imagined she spoke with a haughty crisp accent like the models in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit video.<br><br>"Aaah," the boy from Nishnabotna said, swiveling his eyes way around in their sockets.<br><br>"Desiree Dhont," she said.<br><br>"Aaaaaaaaghhh!" the boy said, and began to struggle.<br><br>"Darius ain't here--yet. He's parking the truck."<br><br>Clyde decided not to stick around and watch the kid rip his own tongue off the window frame. He had a lot to think about now, and the Injuns-Little Twisters game was not the place to do it. Better, and much more his style, to walk around aimlessly in the blinding cold. What he had just witnessed was very important. He was going to have to do a lot of thinking about it.<br><br>He knew from that moment on that Desiree was the woman for him and that he was the man for Desiree and that one day they would get married and have a family. Actually getting introduced to her, getting her to fall in love with him, and all of that stuff were just details.<br><br>The details ended up taking about fourteen years to sort themselves out. Things got off to a false start the next year when Clyde seemed to spend about half his life wrestling Dick Dhont, younger brother of Darius. In any other municipality in the world Clyde would have been the champion of his weight class. In any other state he would have been state champion, and in any other country he would have had a fair shot at the Olympic team. At Wapsipinicon High he was a perpetual loser and object of merciless derision. The only way for him to move upward in life was to defeat Dick on the mat, which he tried to do once a week. On two occasions he actually won, only to be beaten by Dick the following week. Clyde and Dick got to know each other a lot more intimately than many married couples. Naturally he hoped that this would lead to a relationship with Desiree. It did; but the relationship was distant and platonic. Clyde was vindicated six years later when Dick won a gold medal at the Olympics, but this had done him no good during high school.<br><br>Desiree went off to nursing school. She was the only Dhont who could not obtain a full-ride wrestling scholarship to any school, and so she went the ROTC route instead. After she got her degree she spent four years in the Army, paying back her obligation, and then reupped for another couple of years. She married a guy she'd met in the Army and settled down in California. Two years later she divorced him and came back to Wapsipinicon.<br><br>Clyde worked construction for a couple of years, ostensibly to fund a future college education, but by the time he could afford it, he was no longer interested. He did not have any specific job ambitions that required a formal degree, and he had learned that he could read books in the EIU library for free and spend his money traveling.<br><br>He spent his tuition money riding a motorcycle around the United States and Canada and even did the wandering-around-Europe thing for a while. He came back to Wapsipinicon, goofed off for a year, got bored with that, and finally went to the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy in Des Moines. After he graduated, first in his class, he was able to obtain his current job as a deputy county sheriff in Forks County, which included both Wapsipinicon and Nishnabotna. Sooner or later he ran into Desiree. They discovered to their mutual surprise that they had a lot to talk about. They dated for a few months, rented a house in Wapsipinicon and moved in together, then got married a year later.<br><br>After a couple of years of relatively carefree fun, they decided to start a family. They made this decision in June of 1989. They knew other couples who had had trouble getting pregnant and who had spent years pursuing various therapies and adoption strategies, and so they felt that they should start trying as soon as possible. Desiree got pregnant within approximately forty-five minutes.<br>Not long afterward Clyde Banks began to think about career issues again. It was time to move up in the world or find another line of work. The only way to move up was to run for Forks County sheriff in the 1990 election. This would mean putting his boss, Kevin Mullowney, out of a job. Mullowney was a Democrat. Clyde Banks had no choice but to grit his teeth and become a Republican. The Republican party was glad to have him, but there weren't many Republicans in the area, and the party did not have a lot of money.</p><h2>Festive Spirits: Three Christmas Stories</h2><p>The perfect Christmas gift: three festive tales from the brilliant pen of Kate Atkinson.</p><p></p>
